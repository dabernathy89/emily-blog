<p>Happy Friday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts I share the highlights from my week &#8211; from memorable events to the small things that made me smile.</p>
<h1>Monday</h1>
<p>After work on Monday, Daniel and I decided that we just had to finish Season 2 of The Killing so that we could stop watching so much TV (logical, huh?). The series is four seasons long (so far &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if the show is still going), but the first murder mystery lasts through the first and second seasons. We just HAD TO KNOW who did it! So, we made dinner and then watched the remaining five episodes of Season 2&#8230;. It was a late night. And yes, they had us guessing who did it until the very end!</p>
<h1>Tuesday</h1>
<p>Because of all the TV we watched the night before, we kept each other accountable to not watch any TV after work on Tuesday. We went out for pizza at a local place and then went home and worked on a few things. Then I took my computer to bed to do some blog work and fell asleep really early.</p>

<h1>Wednesday</h1>
<p>Over lunch I booked our hotel in Chicago! I have a work training near there in November, so Daniel will be joining me the weekend after to do some touristy things!</p>
<p>We caved and went out to dinner again that night at another local restaurant called Rustico. They had their pumpkin decor up! We enjoyed a delicious meal &#8211; I ordered a burger and fries. No, this has not been a healthy week. We need to be better next week&#8230;.</p>

<p>After dinner we walked across the street to the coffee shop to get some work done.</p>
<h1>Thursday</h1>
<p>Continuing on with my travel hacking plans, I signed up for the Hyatt Visa credit card over lunch. The card comes with two free nights in any Hyatt in the world. I hope to redeem those when we go to NYC in early December!</p>
<p>In the evening we heated up leftovers and watched the season premiere of Parenthood. I finally made some time for reading in bed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so happy it&#8217;s time for the weekend! I&#8217;ll be back with a weekend re-cap on Sunday with <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/the-sunday-currently/" target="_blank">The Sunday Currently</a> link-up!</p>
