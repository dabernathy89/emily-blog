In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>
<p>(1) Since I had the week off, Daniel and I had the chance to drive around Austin and go to our favorite places we hadn&#8217;t been to since before our Europe trip. I love this view of downtown &#8211; especially when it doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m heading into work like it usually does!</p>
<p>(2) We had a glorious week of spring weather here in Texas! We took a nice long walk on the trails by the River, and I couldn&#8217;t stop taking pictures of the pretty blooms!</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp;Before heading out of town for Easter weekend on Friday, we went to see Explosions in the Sky at the Paramount Theater downtown. It was so great to see one of my favorite bands in such a pretty and historic venue. Not many people have heard of Explosions in the Sky, but you&#8217;ve heard them if you ever watched the TV show Friday Night Lights. They play most of the music in the show. They are an instrumental post-rock band from right here in Austin, and this show kicked off the start of their world tour. We really enjoyed it!</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp;To end the week, we had a lovely Easter weekend with the family. Anytime my family gets together and gets dressed up, we take a family picture. I think that this one from Easter weekend turned out pretty well!</p>
<p>Not pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lunch with a friend I hadn&#8217;t seen for ten years. We were best friends in 6th grade before she moved away!</li>
<li>Afternoon stop at a favorite local coffee place, Stouthaus Coffee Pub</li>
<li>Visits with grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, and my cousin&#8217;s sweet little baby</li>
<li>Celebrating the resurrection of Jesus with a wonderful worship service at my grandparents&#8217; church</li>
<li>Dinner at our favorite food truck park</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
