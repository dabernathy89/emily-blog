<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

We hadn&#8217;t eaten there since the day we came to Austin to look for apartments back in December 2014. It&#8217;s a great place to go if you want a combination of tex-mex and breakfast food!</p>
<p>(2) We celebrated my mom&#8217;s birthday as a family this weekend. We had a fun-filled weekend of good food, ice cream, movies, the outdoors, and relaxing.</p>
<p>(3) We enjoyed the sunshine this weekend by walking around some park areas near downtown. We saw a group of turtles legitimately begging for food in the creek! Have you ever seen turtles beg? I haven&#8217;t, and I thought it was really cute. They were just sitting there patiently waiting&#8230;.</p>
<p>(4) My sisters and Daniel and I spent time at a local coffee shop on Monday getting various work/projects done. It was fun to hang out together and be productive at the same time. This is me and my little sister Ellen!</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you know Tom&#8217;s does coffee roasting? We visited the Tom&#8217;s coffee shop in Austin. It is a combined coffee shop and retail store. It is really neat to see a brand with such a good purpose expanding and growing.</li>
<li>We saw the new X-Men movie which I actually thought was pretty entertaining.</li>
<li>We went to Bath and Body Works and picked up some summer candles. I&#8217;ve forced myself to not buy any candles since we got back from Europe until now, so I was so excited to pick up a few. I&#8217;m currently burning the New York: Beautiful Day candle, and it smells just like a sunny day at a park. 🙂</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>I shared our day spent driving around the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2016/05/travel-with-me-an-ireland-road-trip-dingle-peninsula/" target="_blank">here</a>! I took some of my favorite Ireland pictures that day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
