<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

However, even the most stressful weeks have happy moments!</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Walking on the bridge over Lady Bird Lake one night at sunset, we saw lots of people kayaking, canoeing, and (swan) paddle-boarding! I fall in love with Austin all over again every time I walk by the lake.</p>
<p>(2) Saturday started bright and early with a pre-work brunch at Snooze. Look at these pineapple upside-down pancakes! They were delicious, but  I couldn&#8217;t even eat half of them, so I enjoyed them for breakfast Sunday as well.</p>
<p>(3) My promotion at work was announced this week, so Daniel and I walked across the street to a local Italian place to celebrate. We ended dinner with a delicious caramel sundae.</p>
<p>(4) I got a haircut this week across the lake, and I saw these beautiful end-of-summer blooms while walking home across the pedestrian bridge.</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>We saw the movie The Light Between Oceans. I had read the book last year, and it was one of my favorites of the year, so I was very excited to see the movie! I thought the movie did a great job following the book. The scenery and music were beautiful, and the acting was very good.</li>
<li>My sister moved across town this weekend, so my parents came to help her on Sunday. While I was working most of the time they were here, I was able to escape for a quick lunch with them. It was great to catch up.</li>
<li>We met up for dinner at Hula Hut with a couple who just recently moved to Austin. We enjoyed meeting them!</li>
</ul>
