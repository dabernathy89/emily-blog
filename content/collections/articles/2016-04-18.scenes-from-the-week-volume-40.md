<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

It was parked outside one of my client&#8217;s buildings. I ordered a delicious Connecticut-style lobster roll. I&#8217;d had a cold lobster roll in Maine before, but I didn&#8217;t know that the Connecticut-style came warmed with butter. It was delicious!</p>
<p>(2) Friday night I went to Chris Guillebeau&#8217;s Austin stop for his book tour. I&#8217;ve been reading Chris&#8217;s books and <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> for a long time. His writing has inspired a lot of the big steps I&#8217;ve taken in my life over the past few years (blogging, traveling, taking time off from work, going on a reduced work schedule, etc). I also learned about travel hacking from him, and took his <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/courses/make-your-dream-trip-reality-chris-guillebeau-stephanie-zito" target="_blank">Creating Your Dream Trip a Reality</a> course last year. I can&#8217;t recommend his work enough! It was great to get to meet him and hear him give a talk at a local bookstore here in Austin.</p>
<p>(3) We went out for Amy&#8217;s Ice Cream this weekend (one of my favorite places in Austin!), and I always order something with the Mexican Vanilla flavor. After Daniel placed our ice cream order, he came back to the table with an Amy&#8217;s Mexican Vanilla candle! What a fun treat!</p>
<p>(4) For the first time, I met one of my blogging friends in real life! We met for lunch this weekend and had a great time visiting during her time in Austin. Mandy is just as kind and fun in person as she is online. Check out her blog <a href="http://www.mandylivinglife.com/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

<li>It was mostly a normal week of working, so I don&#8217;t have much more to report. But I am very proud to say that I made it to classes at the gym five times this week! I did a mix of spin, yoga, and pilates. Let&#8217;s hope I can keep it up!</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
