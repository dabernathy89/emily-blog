<p>Today I&#8217;m spending time celebrating Thanksgiving with Daniel&#8217;s family in a cabin outside of Nashville. We had to fight snowy weather to get here, but it was so worth it! I wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving and safe travels.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the holiday, I wanted to share ten things I am thankful for:</p>
<p>1. a loving husband</p>
<p>2. a caring family</p>
<p>3. a steady job that challenges me</p>
<p>4. a few days off to spend with family, eat great food, read books, and sleep</p>
<p>5. the Christmas season I look forward to all year</p>
<p>6. coffee</p>
<p>7. the ability to travel with my husband</p>
<p>8. our kitty <a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/2013/11/14/lazy-days-with-banana-1/">Banana</a></p>
<p>9. bookstores and coffee shops &#8211; our favorite date night spots</p>
<p>10. the love of Jesus</p>
