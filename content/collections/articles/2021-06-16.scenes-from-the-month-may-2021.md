<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Month series!  In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous month ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have babies, everyday moments are extra special!</p>
<p>May was so much fun! We (finally) had Caden&#8217;s first birthday party, Mother&#8217;s Day, my birthday, our 10 year anniversary, my mom&#8217;s birthday, and Memorial Day weekend! There was so much to celebrate and to document here.</p>
<h2>Favorites from the Month:</h2>
<p><em>{This section contains some Amazon affiliate links.}</em></p>
<p><strong>Fiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/3xcor1a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Four Winds</a> by Kristen Hannah. Kristen Hannah is such a gem. She can create really well-written stories about friendship, but she can also knock historical fiction out of the park. This book, focused on a family in a small Texas town during the Dust Bowl, is wonderful. I didn&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d be interested in the storyline, but I loved many of the characters and learned a lot about a piece of US history I had not spent much time thinking about before.</p>
<p><strong>Nonfiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/3pIIUrX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lazy Genius Way</a> by Kendra Adachi. This book focuses on how to be a genius about things that matter and lazy about things that don&#8217;t. I loved it &#8211; gave it 5 stars! Since reading this, I starting following Kendra on Instagram and listening to her podcast. She is full of wonderful information and tips!</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> &#8211; Speaking of Kendra Adachi, I&#8217;ve been loving her Spotify playlists. I don&#8217;t use Spotify, so I always have felt like I&#8217;m missing out on the fun playlists various people share. But I recently found the app SongShift which will convert Spotify playlists to playlists on other music platforms, including Youtube Music (which we currently use). It&#8217;s fantastic! I especially love Kendra&#8217;s playlist called &#8220;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0Ddj27lIKOrs2G7lC7GrD7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Scenic Route Pt. 3</a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s full of moody, beautiful music that I have never heard before.</p>
<p><strong>Movie/TV</strong> &#8211; We flew through <em>Mare of Easttown</em> on HBO. Such a good thriller that keeps you guessing!</p>
<p><strong>Item</strong> &#8211; My in-laws gifted me the <a href="https://amzn.to/3vg9c5V" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hatch Restore</a> for my birthday. I love it! I love being able to set up a night time &#8220;routine&#8221; that helps me relax and focus on reading and journaling (rather than scrolling). It plays relaxing sounds of your choice &#8211; I have a few different sounds set up depending on if I&#8217;m having a long reading night or a short one, but the sounds signal to me when it&#8217;s time to set the phone aside to read, then wind down, then fall asleep to the &#8220;pink noise&#8221;. And it wakes me up with really gentle nature sounds and a sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>Activity</strong> &#8211; I have two &#8211; Caden&#8217;s birthday party and celebrating our 10 year anniversary!</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishment</strong> &#8211; Finally making progress on a project I&#8217;ve had in mind for a long, long time.</p>

Many of our family members came to the dedication as well as the party &#8211; it was so fun to celebrate our Baby Boy!</p>
<p>(2) Caden wearing his one-year-old crown. He wasn&#8217;t so sure about it! We did a Milk &amp; Cookies theme for his party.</p>
<p>(3) The party was a lot of fun. It had been POURING the day before (Saturday), so we had postponed the party to Sunday which ended up being a beautiful day.</p>
<p>(4) Caden and his great-grandfather, Papa! Caden was stuffing his face with cookies.</p>

This is a dream hotel that we had been saving for a special occasion! We got so much rest, movie watching, and reading in.</p>
<p>(2) We enjoyed the hotel&#8217;s beautiful library where they made the most delicious margaritas!</p>
<p>(3) Our big celebration dinner was at the new Mon Chou Chou just across the street from the hotel. We throughly enjoyed the French food and atmosphere.</p>
<p>(4) Mother&#8217;s Day was really nice. We went to lunch as a family, and I got to spend most of the rest of the day resting!</p>

<p>(3) Caden doesn&#8217;t have much patience for listening to books being read to him, but he sure loves sitting in a pile of books and flipping through them!</p>
<p>(4) Just a baby and his Kitty Cat!</p>
