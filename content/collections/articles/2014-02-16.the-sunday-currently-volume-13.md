<p>I can&#8217;t even begin to describe how good it feels to be home. The last couple of weeks were full of very long work days in Memphis, TN with no time for personal hobbies. I had thought that I would be able to keep up with my <a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/category/the-sunday-currently/" target="_blank">The Sunday Currently</a> and <a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/category/weekly-wishes/" target="_blank">Weekly Wishes</a> posts while I was gone, but I was very, very wrong! As a result, the only posts that went up were a couple that I had pre-scheduled; I&#8217;m so glad I took the time to write some posts ahead of time so that my blog was not completely abandoned.</p>
<p>I returned home Friday afternoon, and then we went to Chinatown in DC for a nice Valentine&#8217;s/ Daniel&#8217;s birthday dinner at La Tasca and a movie. Saturday we had a good group of friends over to eat BBQ and watch the first three episodes of House of Cards, Season 2. We have had a lot of fun since I&#8217;ve gotten back home, but I am so excited about today because we have no plans or commitments. So far, all I have done is sleep in and get caught up on a few blogs&#8230;. It&#8217;s going to be a great day.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading</em>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Where-Leave-You-Novel/dp/0452296366/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390767800&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=where+i+leave+you" target="_blank">This is Where I Leave You</a> by Jonathan Topper. The only reading I did the past two weeks was on the plane ride to Memphis, so I&#8217;m hoping to read quite a bit today.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>this blog post and not a lot else</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to nothing but <a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/category/lazy-days-with-banana/" target="_blank">Banana</a> purring, but I might turn on a couple YouTube videos soon</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I should have waited to do our tax return later instead of last night because I&#8217;m not happy with our unexpected, bad results! As a tax accountant, I really should have paid more attention to my own tax withholdings throughout the year&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  my Anthropologie Sweet Vanilla Cinnamon candle</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> that I hadn&#8217;t missed the snow day in DC last Thursday! Being cooped up inside working from home while watching the snow fall sounds wonderful!</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>that I can do the couple of productive things I have on my list for today: laundry, unpacking, and getting to my 4:30pm BodyPump class</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>sweatpants and a sweatshirt</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>having time to sit around doing nothing but read blogs and books</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>a nice long Sunday</p>
<p><em>Needing  </em>to start planning our activities for our big trip in May!</p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  very, very happy</p>
