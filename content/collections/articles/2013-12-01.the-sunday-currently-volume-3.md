<p>Today we are on the road heading home from Nashville. I was unable to upload a picture for you today, but I will have a post written up about our Thanksgiving trip very soon. Enjoy your Sunday and safe travels to everyone on the road!</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading</em>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Divergent-Series-Veronica-Roth/dp/0062024035/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385842202&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=divergent" target="_blank">Divergent</a>. I&#8217;ve heard mixed reviews, but I thought I&#8217;d give it a shot because it looks interesting. I&#8217;m taking a break from business books.</p>
<p><em>Writing</em>  a spreadsheet with Christmas gift ideas and gifts already purchased for family and friends. Gotta stay organized and track our spending this season!</p>
<p><em>Listening </em> to Christmas music. I won&#8217;t stop until New Years. 🙂</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I&#8217;m sad Thanksgiving week is over but I&#8217;m very excited to enjoy this Christmas season in DC and then back home in Texas</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  the cold air and the car.</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> we weren&#8217;t losing an hour tonight moving from Central to Eastern time as we travel home. I could use that hour for laundry and sleep tonight!</p>
<p><em>Hoping </em> we can dive right into decorating for Christmas tomorrow night. I hop on a plane again Tuesday night for a two day work trip, so I want to get those decorations up before I go.</p>
<p><em>Wearing </em> the coziest red-striped long-sleeved shirt and an infinity scarf with skinny jeans and house shoes</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> that we were able to relax and enjoy quality time with Daniel&#8217;s family this past week. Our days there were made up of cozy-ing up by the fire, reading, Christmas shopping online, eating yummy food and baked goods, and exploring parts of Nashville.</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to have another day off before diving back into work</p>
<p><em>Needing</em>  one last coffee stop before my driving shift</p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  excited to see a performance of Handel&#8217;s Messiah at the National Cathedral this Friday!</p>
<p><em>Clicking</em>  mostly nothing other than a few sites for Christmas shopping. I want to read as much of my book as possible on this road trip.<a href="https://twitter.com/siddathornton"><br />
