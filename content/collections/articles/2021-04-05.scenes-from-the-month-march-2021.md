<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Month series!  In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous month ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have babies, everyday moments are extra special!</p>
<p>March opened up with my grandmother&#8217;s funeral. We got together as a family to celebrate her life, and it was really special. She will be missed dearly.</p>
<p>We ended the month with our first &#8220;family of four&#8221; vacation! We drove to Port Aransas for a long beach weekend. While it wasn&#8217;t the super sunny weather we&#8217;d imagined for a beach trip, we had a great time. My in-laws joined, so Daniel and I got a date night out too!</p>
<h2>Favorites from the Month:</h2>
<p><em>{This section contains some Amazon affiliate links.}</em></p>
<p><strong>Fiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/3sL6UeB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Majesty</a> by Katharine McGee. This is the second book in the American Royals series. I really enjoyed it! I like the characters, and the plot line is so interesting. The series is about the modern-day American royal family. Such an interesting fictional world to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Nonfiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/31FqT2H" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unfinished</a> by Priyanka Chopra Jonas. I really, really enjoyed this book. What an interesting woman! I knew nothing about her before reading this book, but I love hearing about her life, her entry into the US acting world, her incredible work ethic, and her story of meeting Nick Jonas, falling in love, and getting married.</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> &#8211; Still on a Pandora kick. My latest favorite station is the &#8220;Happy&#8221; station. Such a fun mix of happy tunes!</p>
<p><strong>Movie/TV</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;ve really enjoyed the new episodes of &#8220;This is Us&#8221; this month, especially the scenes on the early days of parenting. I can relate so much, and the character development and dialogue in that show is just beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Item</strong> &#8211; Our Peloton. Does that count as an item? I&#8217;m finally getting in some workouts during the week, and it actually seems to be helping with my dizzy symptoms. It&#8217;s hard to have an excuse when I can literally get a 30 minute spin workout in without leaving my house. I&#8217;m also enjoying the yoga and stretching classes on the Peloton app.</p>
<p><strong>Activity</strong> &#8211; Our beach trip was pretty special. It was the first time both boys went to the beach, and they had a blast. It was not a relaxing trip, but watching them play in the sand and the waves with such joy made it all worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishment</strong> &#8211; Shopping for and planting our new plant babies in the backyard. This probably doesn&#8217;t sound like a big accomplishment to most people, but we have never planted our own plants before. I feel super proud, and I hope they survive and thrive!</p>

Carson thoroughly enjoyed Spiderman and the ice cream. We didn&#8217;t stay for the drive-in movie, but that will be a fun thing to do whenever the kiddos are a little older!</p>
<p>(2) Working with Daddy!</p>
<p>(3) Gramma and Grampa came for a visit. We always love when they are here. 🙂</p>
<p>(4) Caden LOVES this swing at the playground!</p>

It was Carson&#8217;s first time to have it, and he was such a happy boy!</p>
<p>(2) For the first time, Carson sat with us at church. There wasn&#8217;t room at the church nursery. He was such a good boy &#8211; he sat through and watched the music, and he enjoyed playing quietly with the kids&#8217; activity pack during the sermon.</p>
<p>(3) Caden is still loving bathtime. Here he is looking like a Dr. Seuss character!</p>
<p>(4) On our first day of our trip to Port Aransas, we took our golf cart down to the beach and broke in our new sand toys. It was a fun start to our trip!</p>

Bob the Turtle was found at the dolphin tour gift shop, and he has been glued to Carson ever since. We had a great time on the dolphin tour too! We saw so many dolphins!</p>
<p>(2) More beach time with Abuelo and Abuela! On this day, it was really overcast but not too cold to enjoy the day.</p>
<p>(3) Happy beach boy! His favorite activity was playing in the ocean waves.</p>
<p>(4) We stopped at the big shark at a gift shop in Port Aransas. Back when he was younger, Daniel took a picture in the shark on a trip with his church, so he wanted to get one with his family. My have times changed!</p>
