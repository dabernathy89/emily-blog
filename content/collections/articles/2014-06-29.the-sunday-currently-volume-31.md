<p>As you can see from the pictures above, it has been a full and fun weekend. On Friday I went to the OneRepublic concert (with American Authors and The Script opening for them) with a group of friends. Saturday Daniel and I took a day trip to Annapolis, MD that involved browsing shops, ice cream, a delicious seafood dinner, and a beautiful sunset sail. Today I got my nails done with a friend, ran errands, and did some picking up around the apartment.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Keepers-Daughter-Novel/dp/0143037145" target="_blank">The Memory Keeper&#8217;s Daughter</a>. I finished The Fault in Our Stars last week, and I really liked it. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing the movie with my book club (my group of friends who gets together to discuss the book for five minutes and socialize about other things for a couple of hours, ha).</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>in my journal again these days &#8211; finally. I used to be great about daily journaling, and I stopped doing it consistently for about a year, but I&#8217;m back at it!</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to Ed Sheeran&#8217;s new album X (pronounced &#8220;multiply&#8221;). The songs <em>Photograph</em> and <em>Tenerife Sea</em> are my favorites.</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>about the week ahead and getting excited! Daniel is leaving on a backpacking trip with some college friends, and I&#8217;m heading back to Texas for a beach trip with my sisters in Galveston.</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  our new Bath &amp; Body Works Caribbean Escape candle. It&#8217;s a really great summer scent! It&#8217;s making me very excited for the ocean and sand and sun.</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>for a smooth week at work before the holiday</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>pajamas&#8230;. At 7:30pm at night. Yes, I know, it&#8217;s lame. But nothing sounds better to me right now than getting some blogging done and catching up on some shows (currently watching True Detective) all while being as comfy as can be.</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> how much we have been making the most of summer. Evening walks, big trips, weekend trips, reading good books, etc&#8230;. Summer has been good to us so far.</p>
<p><em>Wanting </em> to get back on that sailboat in Annapolis. Last night on the water was magical.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> some sister time! Good thing I have a whole long holiday weekend ahead with Elizabeth and Ellen. Really looking forward to Galveston!<br />

<p><em>Feeling</em>  nervous! I&#8217;m watching True Detective  right now, and it is getting good, but it&#8217;s pretty creepy.</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>blogs and Instagram. Oh, and I&#8217;m starting to sort of use my Twitter account (e_phillips), but I&#8217;m still not quite into it yet.</p>
