<p>Each week, I share goals that I would like to achieve in the week ahead and discuss my progress on last week&#8217;s goals by linking up with <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> and sharing a Weekly Wishes post.</p>
<h1>Last Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Put together my March Project Life layout. </strong>I went to pick up my prints only to find out that Target Photo never received my order. This will be a re-do goal this week. :/</p>
<p>2. <strong>Next book up is&#8230;. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Film-Novel-Marisha-Pessl/dp/140006788X" target="_blank">Night Film</a> by </strong><span style="color:#666666;"><strong>Marisha Pessl.</strong> <strong>I want to read at least 1/3 of it this week to stay on track with my annual goal of reading 24 books.</strong> 1/3 down, 2/3 to go!</span></p>
<p>3. <strong>Get winter coats dry-cleaned and put away in storage. </strong>I dropped them all off at the dry cleaner, so I&#8217;ll pick them up and put them away this week.</p>
<h1>This Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Put together my March Project Life layout. </strong>Let&#8217;s try this again!</p>
<p>2. <b>Make sure I purchase everything that I need for our trip and run any errands for it over the weekend.</b></p>
<p>3. <strong>Call my grandparents.</strong> I was thinking about this today, and I realized that it has been too long since I&#8217;ve talked to them!</p>
<p>I also have my usual reading goals, but I think those are getting repetitive. I&#8217;m also going to be fairly busy at work just to get ahead for my time off, so I&#8217;m keeping my goals light again this week.</p>
