<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

I know I did. We did Thanksgiving with Daniel&#8217;s parents in Fort Worth this year, and we also got to spend time with several friends while we were there.</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Before the end of the short work week, Daniel and I decided to start decorating our apartment for Christmas! I found an adorable little ski chalet house for Banana at Target which he is slowly learning to love. I&#8217;ll share more of our decorations in a future post, but I couldn&#8217;t resist giving you a peek of our (incomplete) tree and Banana&#8217;s new Christmas house.</p>
<p>(2) We had originally planned to head to Fort Worth right after work on Wednesday, but we ended up waiting until Thursday morning to avoid traffic. I was still determined to watch the Macy&#8217;s Thanksgiving Day parade Thanksgiving morning, so we woke up at 4:30am to get ready, load the car, and head out. We made good time and arrived at my in-laws&#8217; in time to watch the parade and help get the house ready for their big Thanksgiving party that afternoon.</p>
<p>(3) Friday night we met high school friends for dinner and then most of us headed back to Daniel&#8217;s parents&#8217; house for a game night. The girls in this photo are some of my very best friends in life, and I have known them for nearly half my life!</p>
<p>(4) My in-laws had a bunch of their friends over for a Thanksgiving Day meal. The weather was beautiful outside (much to my dismay &#8211; I think Thanksgiving should be cold!), so we enjoyed our feast on their back porch. Despite the confusing Texas weather, it was a lovely meal.</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoying my first couple of Caramel Apple Spice drinks from Starbucks on our trip to Fort Worth and back. It&#8217;s definitely a seasonal favorite of mine!</li>
<li>Watching the smoke from a house fire nearby the Abernathys&#8217;. Someone had a Thanksgiving prep accident and their house caught on fire. A man was critically injured and had to be flown by Careflight to get emergency care. I can&#8217;t find any other information on it, but I hope he is okay.</li>
<li>Going to see Thor on Friday afternoon. I was afraid I&#8217;d find the humor too cheesy and hard to get into, but I ended up really enjoying the movie and the humor. I think it was well-done. My favorite part was probably the Matt Damon and Liam Hemsworth cameo.</li>
<li>Lots and lots of party prep! We are pretty excited to have a big group coming over for a Christmas party this coming Friday night, and we have been prepping away! I&#8217;ve gone to Target way too many times throughout the week. Good thing Target is so fun to go to, especially this time of year!</li>
<li>Watching The Grinch (live action). This was our first Christmas movie of the year together. Can&#8217;t wait for the many more to come!</li>
<li>Going to the first Advent service of the season at our church. I&#8217;m going to really love this sermon series, and of course, the Christmas music!</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Blog:</p>

<li>I recently shared <a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2017/11/travel-with-me-roma-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part 1 of our time in Rome</a>! We packed it in on day one, so there was a lot to share. Rome was the final stop on our big European adventure of 2016, so I only have one more city guide to post before I&#8217;ve made it all the way through!</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
