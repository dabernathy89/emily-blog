<p>Today I&#8217;m talking about my favorite things from one of my favorite months of the year! It has been such a great month. I&#8217;m sad to see October go, but November and December have lots of fun in store!</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<h3>Jurassic Park (Film Score) Pandora Station</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve really enjoyed listening to soundtrack music while working this month, and this Pandora station is my favorite place to get it. It has all kinds of great music from great movies!</p>
<h2>Beauty</h2>

<h3><strong>Ulta Professional Vampire Kiss</strong></h3>
<p>I have been having a lot fun painting my nails the past couple of months. I&#8217;m still very new to it, but I&#8217;m getting better, and in addition to purchasing a few new options, I&#8217;m reaching for colors I already have but have not used much. I already had this berry color &#8211; it was given to me by my friend Shannon for us bridesmaids to wear at her wedding. I put it on a couple of weeks ago for the first time since the wedding in June, and I love it! It seems to have a much higher staying power than the Essie or Sephora X polishes I have tried, but about the same as OPI. The color is beautiful and great for the fall/winter season!</p>
<h3><strong>Maybelline FIT Me Concealer</strong></h3>
<p>Ever since I started wearing makeup, I have used the Mary Kay concealer under my eyes. I still think that concealer works great, but I was getting really tired of having to contact a Mary Kay specialist and arrange to pick it up from them. So, I decided to try out a new drugstore concealer, and I&#8217;m very impressed by this one! It works just as well as the Mary Kay product, and it is a great price. I highly recommend it.</p>
<h2>Body Care</h2>
<h3><strong>Bath &amp; Body Works Sweet Cinnamon Pumpkin Body Lotion</strong></h3>
<p>This is my second year to use this lotion. I love how it reminds me of my love of the fall season. It smells like pumpkin bread, cinnamon, and apple cider in one bottle! I know this is going to continue being an annual favorite.</p>
<h2>Candle</h2>
<h3>Bath &amp; Body Works Autumn Candle</h3>
<p>This candle smells amazing! I don&#8217;t really know how to describe it, but my husband and I both think it smells slightly Christmas-y. It is a great blend of fall and Christmas scents &#8211; perfect for enjoying the current season and anticipating the magic of the Christmas season! Plus the packaging of the candle is beautiful and makes a great fall decoration.</p>
<h2>Treats</h2>
<h3><strong>Reese&#8217;s White Chocolate Mini Peanut Butter Cups</strong></h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t eat chocolate. No, I&#8217;m not allergic or trying to be healthy. I legitimately just don&#8217;t like the taste of it. My sister hates it too. Yes, we both know we are weird! However, I do love white chocolate (I&#8217;m told it doesn&#8217;t count as chocolate), so discovering these at a gas station this month was so exciting! I&#8217;ve always felt like I&#8217;ve somewhat missed out by not liking any chocolate, but now that I have peanut butter cups that I can enjoy, I&#8217;m satisfied. I bought the bag pictured above in celebration of Halloween this week. 🙂</p>
<p>What did you love in the month of October?</p>
