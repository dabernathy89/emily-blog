<p>Happy Monday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these quick posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events.</p>

Clockwise starting at the top left:</p>
<p>(1) Wednesday we went on a dinner and coffee double date with my sister and her boyfriend. It&#8217;s always an evening well-spent with those two!</p>
<p>(2) I&#8217;ve heard of New Orleans snow balls before, but when we walked past this stand after dinner Friday night, I had to try it out for myself! We loved them! They are very similar to snow cones but the ice somehow has a creamier texture.</p>
<p>(3) We took a Saturday morning hike on the Greenbelt here in Austin. It was a beautiful morning to be outdoors! We&#8217;ve decided that next time we will wear our swimsuits because there are so many swimming holes along the trail with beautiful, clear water. One of them even had rope swings!</p>
<p>(4) Lots and lots of restaurants and fun places have been opening up across the street from our apartment lately including a new coffee shop called Caffe Medici. Great latte art and great coffee!</p>

<ul>
<li>We tried out a great new Italian place on South Congress Friday night (Botticelli&#8217;s). We will be back!</li>
<li>On Saturday we went to see the new Jurassic Park movie. I really liked most of it. I appreciated how they pulled in pieces of the original movies into this one, and I thought the acting was great.</li>
<li>Sunday morning I woke up to an intense thunderstorm. I don&#8217;t find many other things quite as relaxing as waking up to a storm on a day where I can just fall right back asleep to the sound of the rain and thunder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Monday! Have a great week!</p>
