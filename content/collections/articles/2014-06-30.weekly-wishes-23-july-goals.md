<p>Happy Monday! I hope that everyone had a great weekend and is refreshed and ready to conquer the work week before the holiday! I know I am. I want to get a lot of work off of my plate before heading to Texas on Thursday.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m linking up with <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective&#8217;</a>s Weekly Wishes. I will recap how I did on my goals for June, and then I&#8217;m sharing goals I&#8217;m setting for myself for July.</p>
<h1>June Goals</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Read three books. </strong>I did not reach this goal completely. I&#8217;m working on book #3 right now (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Keepers-Daughter-Novel/dp/0143037145" target="_blank">The Memory Keeper&#8217;s Daughter</a>), but I&#8217;m not far enough along for it to count. So, that means I&#8217;m still pretty behind on the <a href="http://megancstroup.blogspot.com/2014/04/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge.html" target="_blank">Semi-Charmed Summer Book Challenge</a>. I&#8217;m thankful that there are still two months left in the challenge!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Actually clean out my closet and get rid of clothes I no longer wear.</strong> I finally got this done! My closet is still really full (Daniel and I share a very small closet), but it is more organized and is now much easier for me to find things.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Make a game plan for revamping my blog design and layout. </strong>I have a set plan &#8211; now it&#8217;s time to get it done&#8230;.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Create my April Project Life layout. </strong>I have started my layout, and I&#8217;m planning to get this done tonight. If I do, then I will accomplish this goal in June as planned.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Organize my blog feed.</strong> Done! This has made a huge difference in my personal time management. I&#8217;m no longer overwhelmed when I open up my Bloglovin&#8217; feed every morning searching for the posts I should read while eating breakfast. Now I can immediately just go to my &#8220;Favorites&#8221; section to read those everyday, and when I have time, I can browse the other categories I have made.</p>
<h1>July Goals</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Read three books. </strong>Sorry to be so repetitive, but I&#8217;ve got to set reading goals for myself if I&#8217;m ever going to accomplish the <a href="http://megancstroup.blogspot.com/2014/04/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge.html" target="_blank">Semi-Charmed Summer Book Challenge</a>!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Organize my jewelry. </strong>I&#8217;ve been eyeing some nice jewelry organizers at The Container Store for months and months, but they are a bit pricey, so I&#8217;ve held off. This month, I would like to either be really creative and come up with a DIY jewelry organizer (but I&#8217;m really not very creative), or I will allow myself to invest in The Container Store organizers. My jewelry is in such a state right now that I hardly even know what I have to choose from anymore.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Revamp my blog design and layout!! </strong>I am so excited about this goal. I&#8217;ve been all talk about this since I first started my blog, but now it&#8217;s time to actually take action. Thankfully, I have a computer-savvy husband who is going to help me out, but I know it will take a little time to figure everything out.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Write all of my posts about our Europe trip that I have planned&#8230; and post them! </strong>I have been somewhat dragging my feet on editing my photos and writing my travel posts. I have quite a few posts planned, so I want to get all of them written and posted this month. I did post one last month; you can read it <a title="Travel with Me // London – What We Did" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/06/27/travel-with-me-london-what-we-did/" target="_blank">here </a>if you&#8217;d like!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! I&#8217;m looking forward to accomplishing all four of these goals this month. While I will be going on several weekend trips (taking advantage of summertime!), I have more time at home this month than I had in May or June, so I feel like I&#8217;ll be able to these goals done at a more relaxed pace.</p>
<p>What would you like to get done this month?</p>
