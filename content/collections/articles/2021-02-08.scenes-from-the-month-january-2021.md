<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Month series!  In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous month ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have babies, everyday moments are extra special!</p>
<h2>Favorites from the Month:</h2>
<p><strong>Fiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/3ruuxqT" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Testaments</em></a> by Margaret Atwood. This is the sequel to <em>A Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</em>, and I really enjoyed the story. It&#8217;s not as good as the first, but I loved the deeper look into the characters, some who are in the first book and some who are not. Also I&#8217;m really looking forward to the next season of the show on Hulu.</p>
<p><strong>Nonfiction Book</strong> &#8211; I read several nonfiction books this month. My favorite was <a href="https://amzn.to/3cOitwD" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Everything is Figureoutable</em></a> by Marie Forleo. While I don&#8217;t agree with everything Marie had to say, I felt very inspired by this book and am ready to take on and &#8220;figure out&#8221; several ideas I&#8217;ve had floating around in my mind for years.</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m still very into <a href="https://amzn.to/3cOiDnJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">folklore</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3rwOw8g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evermore</a>. Also, I&#8217;m in love with Ed Sheeran&#8217;s new song &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/2YWZzLT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Afterglow</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong>Movie/TV</strong> &#8211; The Crown (Netflix). We are finishing up Season 4.</p>
<p><strong>Item</strong> &#8211; I gave Daniel this for Christmas, but it has ended up being more of a gift for myself. Oops! It is the <a href="https://fromourplace.com/products/always-essential-cooking-pan?gclid=Cj0KCQiA34OBBhCcARIsAG32uvMKsYPSr2OqYZznpo9heXupHZl2g03omR85e2LN5TcVG1YmYJ6COVsaAmUzEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Always Pan</a> by Our Place. It&#8217;s so beautiful, easy to clean, and fun to cook lots of different things with!</p>
<p><strong>Activity</strong> &#8211; Staycation in Austin. My parents took the kiddos for a weekend, and we enjoyed some of our favorite restaurants (outside) and walked around the new part of South Congress. Lots of fun and rest and relaxation!</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishment</strong> &#8211; Potty training Carson! He&#8217;s not 100% potty trained, but we have made a lot of progress! Also, Caden went from taking his first steps to speed walking around the house within this month. Oh, and I&#8217;m getting into a groove of meal planning and cooking good meals for the family &#8211; good, as in, not just frozen pizza, pasta, or mac &amp; cheese most nights. 😉 I think that Always Pan has a little something to do with it!</p>

These three days were LOOONG, but it was special time bonding with our baby boys. Caden took his first independent steps on January 2nd!!</p>
<p>(2) One of Carson&#8217;s prizes for a potty training milestone was this fun <a href="https://amzn.to/3aJVm3v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trash truck toy</a>. He loved it!</p>
<p>(3) We enjoyed some beautiful days in January and took lots of walks and spent a good amount of time together in the backyard.</p>
<p>(4) There aren&#8217;t many other places where you can wear your snowman jammies on top with shorts and bare feet on the bottom!</p>

This boy loves to eat almost anything! Favorites are peas, ham, blueberries, and cheese!</p>
<p>(2) Caden is starting to enjoy flipping through books now, and Carson occasionally will settle down enough to &#8220;read&#8221; to himself as well. What a sweet sight!</p>
<p>(3) Bath time with my second little!</p>
<p>(4) We made our very own Forky! Haha, Carson&#8217;s face kind of looks like Forky&#8217;s in this photo. 🙂</p>
<p><a href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SFTM_January-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_3.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11883" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SFTM_January-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_3.png" alt="SFTM_January 2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com" width="940" height="788" srcset="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SFTM_January-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_3.png 940w, https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SFTM_January-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_3-300x251.png 300w, https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SFTM_January-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_3-768x644.png 768w, https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SFTM_January-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_3-640x537.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></a> (1) Texas is weird. We not only had those beautiful 70 degree days, but we also had snow! I heard this was the first time our town got this much snow in over ten years! It was such a treat, especially in these days where we have mostly been stuck at home.</p>
<p>(2) We watched the Inauguration ceremony. It was refreshing to see a change for our country and to see so many beautiful, powerful women represented.</p>
<p>(3) More play time!</p>
<p>(4) Carson has been loving his balance bike! He&#8217;s gone out on several trail rides in the neighborhood and is getting really confident on the bike.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11882" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SFTM_January-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_4.png" alt="SFTM_January 2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com" width="940" height="788" srcset="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SFTM_January-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_4.png 940w, https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SFTM_January-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_4-300x251.png 300w, https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SFTM_January-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_4-768x644.png 768w, https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SFTM_January-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_4-640x537.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" />(1) Abuela came for a visit, and Carson helped her bake some yummy cookies.</p>
<p>(2) This photo is not from this year. This was taken in May 2020, during Carson&#8217;s 2 year well check. We lost our sweet pediatrician tragically this January. I will be forever grateful that we knew her and were in her care for nearly three years.</p>
<p>(3) During an outdoor play date with our friends, Caden decided he loves basketball. Good thing since he&#8217;s in the 100th percentile for height!</p>
<p>(4) Our neighborhood got a new swing set, and Carson is a big fan!</p>
