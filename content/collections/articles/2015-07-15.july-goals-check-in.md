<p>I&#8217;m back to check on the status of the goals that I <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2015/07/july-goals/" target="_blank">set for myself at the beginning of July</a>. My hope is that posting these updates will help keep me accountable and motivated.</p>

<h2>July Goals</h2>
<h3>Keep up with our purchases daily in our budgeting software.</h3>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been updating the software daily, but I have been updating it multiple times a week which is much easier than going through everything just once a week.</p>
<h3>Try a different approach to getting into a workout routine.</h3>
<p>For over a week, I&#8217;ve been doing the <a href="http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2014/12/30/new-beginners-calendar-2-0-for-2015/" target="_blank">Blogilates Beginner&#8217;s 2.0 Calendar</a>. It&#8217;s fantastic! I purchased the calendar in the Blogilates app for a couple of dollars, and it allows me to check off each workout as I go and to access the YouTube video workouts straight from the app. This is useful since each day&#8217;s work out is made up of an assortment of YouTube videos, so not having to search through YouTube for each one saves time. For some reason, I have not had any trouble getting up in the morning in time to do these 45 minute workouts &#8211; I almost look forward to it!</p>
<h3>Get through six more months of my 2014 Project Life album.</h3>
<p>I actually have already done five months of layouts and have only one more month left to complete my 2014 album! Thanks to The Bachelorette, I have two hours every Monday night to sit in front of the TV and work on Project Life!</p>
<h3>Find a comfortable, waterproof jacket for our trip to Peru.</h3>
<p>We leave July 31, and I currently don&#8217;t own an outdoor jacket like this. I still have not made much time to search for a jacket. At this point, I think I have to buy in store since I probably can&#8217;t guarantee I&#8217;d get any online order in time without paying for rushed shipping. I plan to go to a few sporting good stores this weekend or next.</p>
<h3>Clean out my closet.</h3>
<p>I have not done a closet clean-out yet. I don&#8217;t have any more free weekends this month, so I&#8217;ll have to make time on the weeknights to work on this.</p>
<p>I feel like I have done pretty well this month so far. In addition to these goals, I have given myself a goal to do Duolingo for Spanish at least five times a week. Spanish is coming back to me a lot more quickly than I thought it would, so hopefully I can get us around in Peru. Have a great rest of the week!</p>
