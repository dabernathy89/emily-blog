<p>Whew! What a weekend! Thursday through Saturday I was preparing for and celebrating my friend Shannon&#8217;s wedding. Today we had a great time hanging out with Daniel&#8217;s family and celebrating Father&#8217;s Day. I&#8217;m currently collapsed in bed at Daniel&#8217;s parents house for our last night in Texas, and I&#8217;m very happy and very, very tired.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Out-The-Easy-Ruta-Sepetys/dp/039925692X#" target="_blank">Out of the Easy</a> still. I have had zero reading time since coming to Texas. I&#8217;m hoping to read a lot on the plane tomorrow.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>just this post</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to the fan going. It is HOT here in Texas.</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that it will be quite hard to get back into a normal work routine once we get home</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  nothing. My allergies are really acting up.</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>for no flight delays tomorrow. We have one connection in Atlanta, and we already aren&#8217;t scheduled to get back to D.C. until after 10pm which is late enough for me!</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>pajamas</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> life in general. I feel so blessed to have had the opportunity to see high school and college friends this weekend and to spend time with family.</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to snuggle with <a title="Lazy Days with Banana // 06" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/05/30/lazy-days-with-banana-06/" target="_blank">Banana</a>!</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> some time to catch up on blogging and reading, but unfortunately, it&#8217;s back to work in the morning before our flight and back in the office Tuesday morning<br />
<del></del></p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  unprepared for our trip tomorrow. I&#8217;ve got multiple bags that I randomly threw things into without any organization during the wedding weekend, and I need to re-pack while balancing work in the morning. I just don&#8217;t have the energy to do it tonight.</p>
