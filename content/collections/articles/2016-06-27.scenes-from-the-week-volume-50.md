<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m on post number fifty of this series! I started doing these well over fifty weeks ago, but I ended up taking a long blogging break last year. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

I decided to try out the take-out ramen restaurant down the road on Friday. It was good, but it doesn&#8217;t even compare to the ramen restaurant across the street from us (Ramen Tatsu-ya!).</p>
<p>(2) I spent most of Saturday with a book on the couch before running some errands. By the way, I&#8217;m almost done with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Along-Infinite-Sea-Beatriz-Williams/dp/0399171312" target="_blank">Along the Infinite Sea</a> by Beatriz Williams, and I&#8217;m really loving it! I definitely recommend it for a not-so-light summer read.</p>
<p>(3) I was snapping pictures of my cat on Saturday and loved how this one turned out. He&#8217;s always ready for a photo!</p>
<p>(4) I used this quiet weekend as an opportunity to catch up on blogging and my blog course I&#8217;ve fallen so far behind on. I spent several hours at my favorite local coffee shop.</p>
