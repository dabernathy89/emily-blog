<p>Today I&#8217;m going to write about my week for two reasons: (1) I don&#8217;t have the time or energy to finish the post I was planning to share today and (2) I think I would like to record more of my daily life on this blog. So, I&#8217;m calling today&#8217;s post Scenes From the Week #1 just in case I want to make a series out of this. I cover my weekends in my <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/the-sunday-currently/">The Sunday Currently</a> post every Sunday, so I&#8217;ll stick to weekdays in these posts.</p>
<div style="width: 631px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://emilyabernathy.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140718-222306-80586448.jpg" alt="20140718-222306-80586448.jpg" width="621" height="607" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Banana hanging out with us on a low-key weeknight.

<h1>Monday</h1>
<p>I went to work in the morning knowing that I had a lot to get done this week, so I did not forget to bring a full coffee mug along in the car.</p>
<p>After work I met Daniel&#8217;s Uncle Kevin for the first time. We met at Busboys and Poets in D.C. It was quite the trek to downtown after work, but it was so nice to walk from the metro to the restaurant in the city. I don&#8217;t get into D.C. enough.</p>
<h1>Tuesday</h1>
<p>In the morning, I made it to spin class. Finally!</p>
<p>After a dinner at home of some delicious tilapia and rice, I worked on blogging and cleaned the apartment. I started to feel a sore throat coming on.</p>
<h1>Wednesday</h1>
<p>Again, I went to the gym! This time I made it to BodyPump.</p>
<p>During the day, I definitely knew I had come down with either a bad cold or a sinus infection. Not fun.</p>
<p>This evening was the highlight of my week! Kaitlin and Erik came over for homemade burgers. Kaitlin made peach cobbler for dessert, and we played Carcassonne.</p>
<h1>Thursday</h1>
<p>This evening was really low-key. Daniel and I just worked on our various projects on our computers after watching a show over dinner, and I read some more of my Mindy Kaling book. I also ordered my sister Ellen&#8217;s birthday gifts! I think she will love them.</p>
<h1>Friday</h1>
<p>Work was very busy today. I got a lot done thanks to the OneRepublic album I was listening to on my iPhone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still fighting that sinus infection. Ugh.</p>
<p>We ate dinner outside at a cafe that&#8217;s walking distance from our apartment. Currently, we are watching the movie <em>Her</em>, and then we will pack for our little one night trip to Gettysburg that starts bright and early tomorrow!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my week! I haven&#8217;t decided if I will continue with this series or not. Maybe I will just post one of these occasionally. Also, if I continue, I&#8217;ll try to take more pictures of daily life to share along with these updates. I really want to get back in the habit of daily Instagramming anyway.</p>
<p>I hope everyone has a great weekend!</p>
