<p>// There are some really great book recommendations in <a href="http://www.megbiram.com/43-fiction-books-to-add-to-your-reading-list/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+mimiandmegblog%2FWuzr+%28Meg+Biram+%E2%80%94+The+Edit%29" target="_blank">this post</a>! If only there were more hours in a day to spend time with book&#8230;.</p>
<p>// One of my favorite bloggers took a weekend trip to my city (Austin!) and the surrounding Hill Country. I loved reading about what she did in <a href="http://www.cestchristine.com/2015/05/a-weekend-in-texas/" target="_blank">this post</a> &#8211; it gave me lots of ideas of places I should eat and explore right here at home!</p>
<p>// Every time we travel somewhere new, I plan out several of our meals just to make sure we are eating at some of the very best restaurants a place has to offer. I&#8217;m adding <a href="http://welltraveledwife.com/2015/06/10-restaurants-you-have-to-try.html" target="_blank">these</a> to my list for future travels!</p>
<p>// I also plan ahead for a few coffee stops because I think it&#8217;s so fun to see locals drinking coffee with a friend or a book&#8230;. So I&#8217;m saving <a href="http://www.worldofwanderlust.com/10-london-coffee-shops-you-should-know-about/" target="_blank">this post</a> for our trip to London this December!</p>
<p>// In honor of my favorite grocery store opening three minutes away from our apartment, I&#8217;m sharing <a href="http://modernmrsdarcy.com/2015/04/favorite-things-trader-joes/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ModernMrsDarcy+%28modern+Mrs.+Darcy%29" target="_blank">this post</a> with lots of great ideas for what to pick up. I&#8217;ve got to pick up that creamy toscano with black peppercorns during next week&#8217;s grocery trip!</p>
<p>// <a href="http://www.maiedae.com/maiedae/making-over-my-morning/2132015" target="_blank">This post</a> is a few months old, but I&#8217;m still inspired to get up and make good use of my mornings whenever I read it. I&#8217;m planning to set my alarm clock for 6am tomorrow morning!</p>
