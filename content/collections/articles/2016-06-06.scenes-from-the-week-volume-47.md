<p>Welcome to&nbsp;my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

This time with pretty latte art!</p>
<p>(2) Thursday we celebrated my brother Benjamin&#8217;s high school graduation! I can&#8217;t believe he has been around for 18 years already and that it&#8217;s time for him to go to college. He is going to be a Baylor Bear (sic &#8217;em!), and he got to graduate high school in the Ferrell Center (at Baylor) which I thought was pretty cool. I&#8217;m so proud of who he has grown up to be. Love him!</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp;On Friday we were back in Austin. On my walk back home from getting my haircut, I noticed these beautiful flowers on the pedestrian bridge. They are so lovely!</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp;More walking by downtown. I just love this city!</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Celebrating my sister&#8217;s birthday Friday night with lots of friends</li>
<li>Seeing &#8220;Me Before You&#8221; (and I thought it was really cute and mostly close to the book)</li>
<li>Lounging by the pool at our apartment and doing lots of reading</li>
<li>Being really sick for the first part of the week with a sore throat. I&#8217;m fine now, but I&#8217;m still struggling to talk!</li>
<li>Sunday dinner and good conversation with our friends&#8217; family</li>
</ul>
