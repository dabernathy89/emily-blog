<p>Happy Easter! He is risen! We have so much to be thankful for as we are reminded of what our Lord and Savior did for us on this holiday. While we wish we could be with our family in Texas today, we are happy to have good friends that we have shared this weekend with yesterday and today.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Cuckoos-Calling-Robert-Galbraith/dp/0316206849" target="_blank">The Cuckoo&#8217;s Calling</a>. Almost done!</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>lots of Happy Easter text messages</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>The David Crowder Band Pandora station</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>how great it was to speak with my family on the phone just now and what a beautiful Easter day it is! And how much we loved the message and music at our Easter service last night.</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  banana bread baking for our small group Easter lunch today</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> we could join my family for their Easter lunch today</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>that everyone has a beautiful day filled with family, friends, and good weather</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>pajamas. I need to start getting dressed for lunch soon!</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> Spring and seeing people enjoying the outdoors</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to get some cleaning and reading done this afternoon</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> water. Again, I&#8217;m not drinking enough of it.<br />

<p><em>Feeling</em>  happy</p>
