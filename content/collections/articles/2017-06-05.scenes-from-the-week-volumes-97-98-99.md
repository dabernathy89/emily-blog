<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

The last three weeks have had some very good moments as well as some very low moments, both out in the world and within my personal life.  These posts are such a great way to focus on the joyful moments in life, both big and small, and are a reminder for me to be thankful for all of life&#8217;s blessings despite tragic events that happen.</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Austin has a lot of great BBQ, but I think I&#8217;ve found my favorite. We went to Micklethwait&#8217;s Craft Meats for the first time a couple of weeks ago, a food truck on the East Side. The brisket and cheesy grits were delicious! Plus it made the top ten on the Texas Monthly&#8217;s 50 Best BBQ Joints this year.</p>
<p>(2) During Memorial Day weekend, we traveled to Greensboro, North Carolina to attend my cousin Graham&#8217;s wedding. It was a wonderful weekend full of family time and happy moments. Christina, my cousin&#8217;s new wife, is from a Greek family. The wedding was a Greek Orthodox ceremony, and there was lots of Greek dancing at the reception. It was fun to try it out but even more fun to watch. My favorite part of the reception was dancing with my other cousin&#8217;s little two-year-old son! He was getting really into his little dance moves and would not stop holding my hand!</p>
<p>(3) After the wedding day, Daniel and I drove to Asheville for a short vacation. Asheville has been on our vacation list for a while, and it did not disappoint! It is very much a foodie town, so we ate several wonderful meals, took a food tour, and went to some breweries. We also visited the Biltmore and took an audio tour of the mansion and a nice long walk through the gardens. On our last morning, we drove a part of the Blue Ridge Parkway to take in the gorgeous green mountain scenery (pictured here). It was great to get away and enjoy some history, food, and nature together in Asheville.</p>
<p>(4) This past week was my sister Elizabeth&#8217;s birthday. While this wasn&#8217;t at her birthday party, we had dinner together earlier in the week at Launderette, and we had to get the birthday cake ice cream sandwiches. Both my sister and I hate chocolate, and it&#8217;s not too often that a restaurant serves a special dessert without any chocolate in it, and Launderette is known for this dessert. It was so delicious!</p>

<li>Starting and finishing <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2rH1EvN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Into the Water</a></em> by Paula Hawkins, the author of <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2sF5Eu1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Girl on the Train</a>.</em> I enjoyed the book, but I found it to be much creepier than <em>The Girl on the Train</em>.</li>
<li>So many fun things from our Asheville trip are not pictured here, but I&#8217;ll be writing up a travel guide/trip recap on Asheville sometime in the future!</li>
