<p>Happy Halloween Friday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts I share the highlights from my week &#8211; ranging from memorable events to the small things that made me smile.</p>
<h1>Monday</h1>
<p>I left work early for a dentist appointment. I had to get a filling (boo!). I think this was only the second one I&#8217;ve ever had. I was glad to get it over with.</p>
<p>That evening I went to the mall to check out some of the holiday stuff at Lush and Sephora (and I may have made a few fun purchases), and then I went grocery shopping for our lunches for the rest of the week.</p>
<h1>Tuesday</h1>
<p>I went to my spin class in the morning. They just released a new set of tracks, and I love the music!</p>
<p>Daniel and I were both craving apple cider after work, so I made this <a href="http://bakerette.com/crockpot-hot-apple-cider/" target="_blank">crock pot apple cider recipe</a> (pictured below). Delicious!</p>

<h1>Wednesday</h1>
<p>After work, I took my time going from the car to the apartment. The trees are just so gorgeous in all of their fall colors, so I really wanted to soak in the season and take some good pictures.</p>

<p>I spent a long time in the evening working on my <a href="https://www.artifactuprising.com/" target="_blank">Artifact Uprising</a> trip book. I think it&#8217;s coming along nicely! I took a hot bath and read my new book from the library before heading to bed.</p>
<h1>Thursday</h1>
<p>Daniel and I really wanted to get out Thursday evening, so we went to see that movie Nightcrawler with Jake Gyllenhaal. I thought it sounded like it was going to be a horror movie when Daniel brought it up, so I immediately watched the trailer to ensure that I was not going to see a horror movie. It ended up just being a very well-done thriller (not a horror), but it does leave you feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>Have a fantastic Halloween weekend! Enjoy the spookiness and the candy and the extra hour!</p>
