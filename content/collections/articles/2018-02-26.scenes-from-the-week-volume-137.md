<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts  help serve that purpose.</p>

I just got home from dropping my sister Ellen off at the bus station, and right before that, we took a nice long walk to the library downtown. The weather is just beautiful this afternoon in Austin! This weekend was wonderful &#8211; my whole family was in town to celebrate my Dad&#8217;s birthday, and we did lots of relaxing, eating, and hanging out.</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) I was able to get free tickets to the St. Vincent concert at ACL through my work. I actually had heard very little of her music, but I knew Daniel really liked the band. The concert was great. St. Vincent is pretty weird with her outfits and sets, but the music is fun, and I especially loved the opening act &#8211; her aunt and uncle Tuck &amp; Patti. They are an adorable couple and musical duo performing primarily jazz music. I don&#8217;t typically love jazz, but these two were such a joy to watch. My favorite part was watching Tuck do a solo guitar performance of Santana&#8217;s &#8220;Europa&#8221;. His guitar skills are incredible!</p>
<p>(2) As I mentioned, the weekend was fun-filled celebrating my dad&#8217;s birthday. The first outing was a visit to Top Golf Saturday morning. It was a nice, cool day. I&#8217;m in no way a golfer, but I think it&#8217;s a great way to hang out with a group!</p>
<p>(3) Friday night after dinner at Shady Grove, we came back to the apartment for a Star Wars themed party with cake (ordered from local bakery Sweetish Hill!) and a quick game.</p>
<p>(4) I snapped this photo of Ellen taking in the view at the top of the downtown library. The rooftop patio is my favorite part of the library, and the gorgeous day made it even better!</p>

<li>Finishing <em><a href="http://amzn.to/2GJygt7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Woman in the Window</a></em>. This is a great page-turner that kept me guessing until the end! I read this 450 page book in about four days which is pretty quick for me.</li>
<li>Taking a rare, wonderful nap on a Saturday afternoon</li>
<li>Enjoying coffee Daniel brewed from his new Chemex for the family. The Chemex is a great way to make pour overs for bigger groups! This week we are enjoying some Kenyan Peaberry beans from AKA Coffee roasters out of Oakland. We order our beans through the <a href="http://www.mistobox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mistobox</a> subscriptions service and love it.</li>
<li>Eating family dinner on Saturday at TLC with a stop at Lick Ice Cream on the way home</li>
<li>Enjoying a post-church brunch at Fareground with the family. The brunch selection at the Henbit counter is especially good!</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that everyone has a great week!</p>
