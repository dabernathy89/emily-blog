<p>Twice a month I link up with <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to join the community of bloggers who share their goals for the week in the Weekly Wishes link-up. I&#8217;m continuing to update my goals for the entire month twice a month rather than having a new set of goals each week. Right now, thinking about my to-dos in this big picture format has been working the best for me.</p>
<p>Once again, I&#8217;m not doing so well with these goals. I&#8217;m not sure what the deal is &#8211; the evenings and weekends are all going so fast!</p>
<h2>October Goals</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Finish that <a href="http://www.artifactuprising.com/site/home" target="_blank">Artifact Uprising</a> book for our London &amp; Paris trip. </strong>I&#8217;ve made a couple more pages.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Do a SkillShare class.</strong> No &#8211; still struggling to find the time for these. Do any of you have outside learning as a part of your regular routine? If so, please share your tips and tricks in the comments below!</p>
<p>3. <strong>Get back into reading regularly.</strong> I have been reading more regularly now. It has been great!</p>
<p>4. <strong>Make the bed everyday.</strong> Of all the days we have been home, I think I&#8217;ve only missed one day of making the bed! I&#8217;m very excited to be getting back into this good habit.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much time left until the end of the month, and it&#8217;s a busy rest of the month, so I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll be able to get much more done&#8230;. But I can try!</p>
