<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

We had the opportunity to go with some good friends of ours (Kaelin and Andres) and had the BEST time! This was our second time to do Christmas in NYC, and despite the freezing cold, it was a magical whirlwind of a trip!</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Our first night in the city, we made our way to Rockefeller Center to see the tree. For some reason, it was much less crowded than when we went two years ago, so we were able to get better pictures this time around!</p>
<p>(2) We found a great photo spot while walking around Central Park (with coffee in hand, of course!). A big perk to traveling with friends is actually getting good pictures with our spouses throughout the trip! In my experience, strangers tend to not take the best photos. This is one of my favorites of just the two of us.</p>
<p>(3) A big reason we were able to do this trip is because of travel points and free nights. We were able to stay in the lovely Intercontinental Barclay hotel in Midtown for free for our first two nights, and Kaelin and Andres booked the third night in the financial district. They win for picking the hotel with the best view! We could not believe it when we walked in and saw that this was our view for the night!</p>
<p>(4) Another highlight of the trip is the Heart of the Village food tour we took on Saturday with <a href="http://www.foodsofny.com/" target="_blank">Foods of New York Tours</a>. My favorite food stop of the tour was this spinach and artichoke pizza from Artichoke Pizza. I&#8217;ve never tasted anything like it, but it was warm, soft, and crispy all at the same time. It hit the spot! This food tour company offers tours in areas all over the city, so we plan to do a different one each time we visit NYC in the future!</p>

<li>There are many things not pictured here, so sometime in the future I will do a full NYC at Christmas <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/travel-with-me/" target="_blank">Travel With Me</a> post to share everything. In summary, some other highlights from the weekend include: walking the High Line, visiting the festive Chelsea Market, seeing the light show at Saks 5th, watching our friend reenact a Home Alone 2 scene at the Plaza Hotel, trying out my very first cronut at Dominque Ansel Bakery (worth the hype!), going to Katz Delicatessen (also very much worth the hype!), and exploring both the Bryant Park and Union Square Christmas Markets.</li>
