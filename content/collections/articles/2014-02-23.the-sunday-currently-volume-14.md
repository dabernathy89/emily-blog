<p>It has been a nice weekend! I&#8217;m look forward to today as it&#8217;s yet another Sunday with not many set plans.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading</em>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Where-Leave-You-Novel/dp/0452296366/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390767800&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=where+i+leave+you" target="_blank">This is Where I Leave You</a> by Jonathan Topper. Almost done! I&#8217;ll let y&#8217;all know my thoughts when I&#8217;ve gotten through it &#8211; hopefully I&#8217;ll finish today.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>a grocery list</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to a Pandora station based off of &#8220;Come to Me&#8221; by the Goo Goo Dolls</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>I&#8217;m ready for spring and time spent outside exploring the city</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  gross. I just got back from BodyPump and have not showered yet. I wanted to get this post written first!</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> that I could be home in Texas celebrating my Dad&#8217;s 50th birthday with my family today. Happy birthday, Dad! I&#8217;m so blessed to have you in my life.</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>for a nice day catching up on reading and some other hobbies. We finished House of Cards, Season 2 last night, so it&#8217;s time for other things.</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>my workout clothes</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>the changing of the seasons. It&#8217;s supposed to snow again this weekend, so we aren&#8217;t out of winter yet, but we got a glimpse of spring this weekend, and it is making me excited for all things fresh, pastel, and warm.</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>coffee! I haven&#8217;t had any today. I must fix that soon!</p>
<p><em>Needing  </em>a slower week at work.</p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  productive. Yesterday I cleaned a bit, did laundry, went to yoga, went to church, and got some work done. Today I&#8217;ve already made it to the gym and I&#8217;m hoping to keep getting some things done today while still having time to relax.</p>
<p><em>Clicking </em> Facebook. I&#8217;ve been a bit overwhelmed by my Bloglovin&#8217; feed lately. I think it&#8217;s because I didn&#8217;t check it much while on my two-week business trip to Memphis, so I&#8217;ve kind of gotten out of the habit. I think I may just need to clean out the blogs I follow so that it&#8217;s less overwhelming to look at. There are many, many blogs that I loved reading when I first got into blogs but are now either too consumed with sponsored posts or have just lost the charm that I originally loved about them.<a href="https://twitter.com/siddathornton"><br />
