<p>I didn&#8217;t purchase these books, but my husband and I spent quite a lot of time reading through them at Barnes &amp; Noble and getting ideas for our Europe trip in May! We really liked the simplicity of the book and how it gives ideas for different self-guided walks throughout they city (including a royal walk in London and a Hemingway walk in Paris).</p>
<h2>TV</h2>
<h3>Grey&#8217;s Anatomy</h3>
<p>I just love this show. No, it may not be as good as it used to be, but it definitely still keeps my attention, and I look forward to watching it each week as I have time.</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<h3>Dave Barnes</h3>
<p>Dave Barnes has been a favorite artist of mine for a long time. I love his song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNB_McG-1mA" target="_blank">Until You</a> (check it out!). I listened to his new album (Golden Days) a lot throughout the month of March, and it definitely helped me stay cheery during a very busy month for work. Daniel and I are actually going to his concert in DC tomorrow night at the Hamilton! I am so looking forward to it!</p>
<h2>Food/Drink/Snack</h2>
<h3>Starbucks Vanilla Macchiato</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/04/20140410-214905.jpg" alt="20140410-214905.jpg" /></p>
<p>Now I know Starbucks probably was making this long before they started heavily marketing it, but I didn&#8217;t even think about ordering this drink until I saw their advertisements. I enjoy vanilla lattes, and I really like a caramel or hazelnut macchiato, but I LOVE their vanilla macchiato! I ordered quite a few during March, and I actually picked one up today.</p>
<h3>Sabra Roasted Pine Nut Hummus</h3>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been taking pretty much the exact same lunch to work every single day, but one thing that does change from week to week is the flavor of hummus that I get to go with my crackers. In March I discovered this Pine Nut Hummus, and it is just so good! It&#8217;s probably my favorite hummus flavor I&#8217;ve ever tried.</p>
<h2>Body Care</h2>
<h3>Victoria Secret Warm &amp; Cozy Body Spray</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/04/20140410-214946.jpg" alt="20140410-214946.jpg" /></p>
<p>This stuff smells so good! The bottle says the scent is toasted vanilla and peony, and I think that description is really accurate. It came in a small travel-sized bottle, so I&#8217;ll be taking it with me on my trip in May.</p>
<h2>Beauty</h2>
<h3>No. 7 Lift &amp; Luminate Night Cream &amp; Eye Cream</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/04/20140410-214924.jpg" alt="20140410-214924.jpg" /><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/04/20140410-214938.jpg" alt="20140410-214938.jpg" /></p>
<p>I found these products at Target when I was shopping around for some skincare items. I figured it was time for me to start moisturizing my skin or get into some sort of a skin care routine. I&#8217;m so glad I picked these up! I can definitely tell a difference on in my skin &#8211; it&#8217;s clearer, and I don&#8217;t get as many dry patches as I used to. The picture actually shows the Restore &amp; Renew night cream (rather than the Lift &amp; Luminate). I ran out of my first container of the L&amp;L, so I decided to try the R&amp;R version. I definitely prefer the Life &amp; Luminate because my skin feels much more oily in the morning after applying the Restore &amp; Renew. I&#8217;ll be switching back after I finish this one.</p>

<p>I love this blog! Casey writes all about travel. She and her husband take so many trips throughout the year &#8211; I&#8217;m always inspired to plan my next trip when I read her posts. Her husband takes beautiful pictures on all of  their trips, and she offers tons of recommendations for destinations all over the world. I based <a title="Travel with Me // New England (Part I)" href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/2013/11/21/travel-with-me-new-england-part-i/" target="_blank">our New England trip</a> last fall off of her trip to New England. We went to southern Maine, Rhode Island, and Boston all in one trip, and I would not have ever thought to combine these destinations into one trip if I hadn&#8217;t read her post. I&#8217;m also planning to go to several restaurants and sites in London and Paris based off of her blog posts. If you want trip ideas or just want to travel vicariously through Casey&#8217;s blog, go <a href="http://www.truecoloursblog.com/" target="_blank">check it out</a>!</p>
