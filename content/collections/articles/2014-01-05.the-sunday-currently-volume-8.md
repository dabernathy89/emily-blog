<p>This picture sums up what I&#8217;m up to this afternoon: in Starbucks, working on various things with much-needed coffee and a fresh pack of tissues. The cold that I had last week is better but definitely not gone.</p>
<p>We got back in from Texas yesterday afternoon. After we got home and snuggled with <a title="Lazy Days with Banana // 02" href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/2013/12/17/lazy-days-with-banana-02/">Banana</a> for a bit, we went right to work unpacking and putting away the Christmas decorations (so sad!). It&#8217;s nice to be back, and I&#8217;m looking forward to getting back into a routine, but I&#8217;m definitely going to miss the friends, family, and places we visited over the past couple of weeks.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading </em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Insurgent-Divergent-Book-Series/dp/0062024043" target="_blank">Insurgent</a> (Book #2 of the <em>Divergent</em> Series). I&#8217;m about a third of the way through, and I&#8217;m very interested to see what happens.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-100-Startup-Reinvent-Living/dp/0307951529/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388335458&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=%24100+startup" target="_blank"><br />
</a></p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>our budget, meal plan, and grocery list. I&#8217;m trying to get our finances and meals organized for our first work week in the New Year.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to Starbucks background noise. Sometimes that&#8217;s the best noise to motivate me to get things done. I am mourning the end of my time to listen to Christmas music, but hopefully I&#8217;ll find an interest in some other music soon. I&#8217;ll definitely need a new, fun playlist to get through busy season at work!</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I can&#8217;t believe our time in Texas for the holidays is over! Now it&#8217;s time to crack down and get back to work. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about that yet.</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  Starbucks coffee. Yum&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> that time would slow down. Fall, Thanksgiving, and the Christmas season (my favorite times of the year) went by so incredibly fast.</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to get our grocery shopping for the week done this evening after church</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>jeans, a long-sleeve t-shirt, a scarf, and my coat. It&#8217;s not very warm in this coffee shop unfortunately.</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> that Daniel and I already got a workout in today. We went to BodyPump this morning! We were so motivated that when we arrived to our main gym and it was closed do to a power outage, we dragged ourselves over to the next closest Gold&#8217;s Gym instead of being lazy and going back home.</p>
<p><em>Wanting </em> a little more energy. I really want a nap today, but there is not time for that. In a couple of hours, we will head to church and then hopefully the grocery store.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to get back to work on my <a title="Travel with Me // New England (Part I)" href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/2013/11/21/travel-with-me-new-england-part-i/" target="_blank">Travel with Me</a> posts. I love doing those, but they definitely take a lot of time.</p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  happy to be settled and unpacked at home but unsure about this coming week</p>
<p><em>Clicking </em> Bloglovin&#8217; and my grocery list.<a href="https://twitter.com/siddathornton"><br />
