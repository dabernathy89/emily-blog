<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>(1) Friday evening was wonderful. Ellen (my youngest sister) came in from Dallas, and we went out to get Mexican for dinner. Afterward we met up with Elizabeth, Jason, Kaelin, and Andres at Opa for a drink and some great conversation around this fire pit.</p>
<p>(2) Saturday I went to my friend Kim&#8217;s baby shower. Baby Loretta is due next month, and we had the best time celebrating her upcoming birth. The shower had an adorable theme, and it was such a fun, girly afternoon. I got to see another friend from high school, Kelsey, who is also in this picture.</p>
<p>(3) Also on Saturday, my parents came into down to have a belated birthday celebration for my Dad. We went out for Mexican (again!) and then spent the evening playing games.</p>
<p>(4) Sunday evening Daniel and I went out to a pizza restaurant (Toss Pizzeria!). The highlight of the meal was this brussel sprout salad. It was amazing, and I will go back for it sometime&#8230;</p>

<li>Nothing 🙁 I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to keep up with blogging during busy season at work, but I&#8217;m not doing a good job of it. I&#8217;m hoping to have another travel post up later this week!</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
