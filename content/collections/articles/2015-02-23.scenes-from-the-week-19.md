<p>Happy Monday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these quick posts, I share the highlights from my week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events.</p>

<p>Clockwise starting at the top left:</p>
<p>(1) I&#8217;ve been working on getting up earlier and earlier to make the most of my favorite part of the day. A perfect morning to me is made up of breakfast,  the Bible, my journal, coffee, a healthy juice, and a great book.</p>
<p>(2) This weekend was absolutely gorgeous here in Austin. Saturday afternoon, we took a long walk by the river and spotted those adorable turtles sunbathing.</p>
<p>(3) While walking around the city, I took some pictures of the buildings. That building with the pointy top is where I work!</p>
<p>(4) Daniel&#8217;s mom came to visit, so we spent Saturday morning/ early afternoon exploring the city &#8211; we walked around a farmers&#8217; market where we saw this group playing some great music.</p>

<ul>
<li>Wednesday night my sister and her boyfriend cooked a great dinner for us (some of the best salmon I&#8217;ve had!)</li>
<li>Friday night, we had dinner and coffee with Daniel&#8217;s mom.</li>
<li>On Saturday, we looked around Toy Joy for the first time and enjoyed brunch at Trudy&#8217;s.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great Monday!</p>
<p>P.S. I know I&#8217;ve been fairly quiet on this blog. I&#8217;m having a tough time with balance these days &#8211; it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m working on! I hope to be back to my posting routine soon.</p>
