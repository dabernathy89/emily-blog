<p>We got in late last night from our one day trip to explore Philadelphia with my cousin Josh and his wife Meredith. It was quite a surprise to us that Philly is less than 3 hours away from our apartment in Arlington, VA! We had a blast learning some history, eating some fantastic (not-so-good-for-you) food, and spending quality time with Josh and Meredith. I&#8217;m planning to write up a post about this trip in Philly soon</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading</em>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Thief-Markus-Zusak/dp/0375842209" target="_blank">The Book Thief</a>. My book club meets for the first time next week, so I&#8217;ll definitely have this read by then. This morning, I&#8217;m also reading tons of blog posts. Oh, and magazines. I really love magazines, and I have built up a huge pile that I haven&#8217;t read yet. I&#8217;m hoping to read one or two today.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>nothing but this post this morning. I&#8217;m just doing a lot of reading!</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to various YouTube videos. Ever since last fall, I&#8217;ve really gotten into watching different YouTubers while getting ready or working on other things. Check out a few of my favorite channels <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/organizedlikejen" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5zSySQab9SA6Wz569WDgqw" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIdqNsL4HNFjpILqDbBPJOQ" target="_blank">here</a>. Be warned: you might unexpectantly get addicted like I did.</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that it&#8217;s going to be a good day. I do need to go into the office this afternoon, but it will only be for a couple of hours. After that, we will go to church and grab some groceries, and hopefully I will have time to work on my Project Life album this evening.</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  my Vanilla Bean Noel candle. It&#8217;s almost gone and then I can move on to some of my other fun scents in my collection I built up over Christmas!</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> that I had MLK Day off tomorrow with my husband</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to build up some energy. I have been in a never-ending state of tiredness for a few months now.</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>pajamas! And I don&#8217;t intend to get dressed for the day until I need to go into the office.</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>the current series we are doing at church. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://fairfax.cc/thisweekend/" target="_blank">How to Eat an Elephant: A Five-Week Journey Towards Holiness</a>. It really is fascinating and a great way to start off the New Year.</p>
<p><em>Wanting </em> to update my new planner for the year! It finally arrived late last week.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to re-fill my coffee mug 🙂</p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  pretty good!</p>
