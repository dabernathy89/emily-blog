<p>I used to link up each week for <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/the-sunday-currently/" target="_blank">The Sunday Currently</a> link-up hosted by one of my favorite bloggers. When she stopped doing the link-up, I continued to do TSC on my own and sometimes I&#8217;d link up with another blogger who started hosting the link-up. I loved writing those posts, but I loved reading other peoples&#8217; even more. Eventually (once I reached my <a title="The Sunday Currently, Volume 50" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/11/the-sunday-currently-volume-50/" target="_blank">fiftieth TSC post</a>), I felt my responses were becoming too dry and repetitive to be answering the same prompts every single week, so I (begrudgingly) decided to stop.</p>
<p>Recently, I stumbled upon another <a href="http://www.anneinresidence.com/2015/01/currently.html" target="_blank">Currently link-up</a> that takes place monthly. It sounded like something I&#8217;d be interested in, so I began to look into it and saw that the hosts actually change up the prompts each month! I&#8217;ve decided that this is the perfect way for me to continue writing Currently posts and have access to many others&#8217; posts to read. I&#8217;m thrilled to join <a href="http://www.anneinresidence.com/" target="_blank">Anne</a> and <a href="http://www.dearest-love.com/" target="_blank">Jenna</a> each month!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m late to the game this month, but I wanted to make sure I got in a January Currently post. I plan to follow the hosts&#8217; prompts each month while keeping some of my own favorite prompts each month.</p>

<b>Planning | </b>Travel for 2015. 🙂 You can read about our travel plans <a title="2015 Travel Wish List" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2015/01/2015-travel-wishlist/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Hoping |</b>  For a smooth and painless busy season this year. Are there any other CPAs out there in the same boat right now?</p>
<p><b>Baking |</b> You know, I don&#8217;t think I have baked anything since we moved into our new apartment a couple of weeks ago. My husband did roast veggies in the oven this week&#8230;. But, I definitely am going to need to bake something tasty soon!</p>
<p><strong>Wearing</strong> |  Jeans, a tank top with a cardigan, and a big cozy scarf &#8211; thank goodness for that scarf because it is freezing in this coffee shop!</p>
<p><strong>Resolving</strong> | To actively become the life-long learner I&#8217;ve wanted to be for years. This means taking courses (Skillshare or any other online courses), using Duolingo to brush up on my Spanish, keeping up with current events (<a href="http://theskimm.com/" target="_blank">theSkimm</a> is the best I can do right now, and it&#8217;s awesome!), and constantly be reading a book. I&#8217;d like to add in listening to podcasts and getting back into piano lessons at some point in the near future too. What do you like to do to keep learning?</p>
<p><strong>Reading</strong> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paris-Wife-Random-Readers-Circle/dp/0345521315/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1421293603&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+paris+wife" target="_blank">The Paris Wife</a>. I keep picking this up and putting it down whenever it is my turn for a library book I had on hold. I&#8217;m determined to finish it this time. I just love the story!</p>
<p><strong>Listening</strong> | To the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outlander-Diana-Gabaldon/dp/0440212561" target="_blank">Outlander</a> audio book. I&#8217;ve been curious about reading this series for a while but was deterred by the amount of pages and number of books in the series. I&#8217;ve decided to chip away at it through audio books during my new daily bus commute. I&#8217;m enjoying that time so much so far!</p>
<p><strong>Dreaming</strong> | About 2015 and all of the adventure that awaits as we explore our <a title="Thoughts on Moving" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2015/01/thoughts-on-moving/" target="_blank">new city</a> and other destinations</p>
<p><strong>Cooking</strong> | <a href="http://mixandmatchmama.blogspot.com/2013/10/dinner-tonight-slow-cooker-chicken.html" target="_blank">this recipe</a> for dinner, It&#8217;s extremely simple but so delicious and convenient. It is definitely comfort food that I want more of in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Drinking</strong> | Trader Joe&#8217;s French Vanilla coffee blend. The flavor is just want I need when I wake up in the morning!</p>
