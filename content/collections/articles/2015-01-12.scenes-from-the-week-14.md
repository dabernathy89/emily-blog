<p>Happy Monday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these quick posts, I share the highlights from my week ranging from memorable events to the small everyday things I want to document.</p>
<p>The main highlight of this week was that it was my first week at my new office. I&#8217;m still working for the same accounting firm as I was in DC, so thankfully the transition went much more smoothly than it would have been had I switched companies. I really like my new co-workers too!</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong> evening, my sister Elizabeth and her boyfriend Jason joined us at our apartment for dinner and a game of Settlers of Catan. I&#8217;m so excited to be living in the same city as Elizabeth now!</p>
<p>The original Whole Foods is near our apartment, so we went to check it out last weekend. While we were there, we picked up a fun dessert &#8211; Julie&#8217;s Organic Lemon Yogurt with Vanilla Cookie sandwiches. We enjoyed them together on <strong>Wednesday</strong> night after a coffee shop date. They were fantastic&#8230;.  I kind of wish we hadn&#8217;t tried them because they were very pricey for just four cookie sandwiches.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday</strong> I tidied up around the apartment. The place is coming together and is slowly starting to feel like a real home.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong> we enjoyed a tasty Mexican dinner at Iron Cactus and went home to get cozy and catch up on our favorite shows that resumed this past week.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong> was mostly filled with meal planning, grocery shopping, getting the car inspected, and other various errands. That evening we went to our friends&#8217; (Kim &amp; Jordan) apartment for dinner and a movie. We have been friends with Kim and Jordan since high school, and they dated and got married around the same time as us. It&#8217;s so fun that we get to hang out with them more often now!</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong> we visited a new church, had lunch at a cool Japanese restaurant with Elizabeth and Jason, went to take a look at Graffiti Park (pictured below), and did some work at a coffee shop.</p>
