<p>It&#8217;s Coffee Shop Sunday! It has been a long time since Daniel and I have had the time to sit at a coffee shop and read and work on our various projects. I&#8217;m not complaining &#8211; we have been traveling a ton (my favorite), but it has been nice to have a bit more of a weekend routine this time around. Well, sort of&#8230; We went camping Friday night at Prince William Forest park, but it was a quick little outing. We left Friday right after work, set up camp, made dinner and breakfast over the fire, did some hiking, and we were home by 3 yesterday. Ever since then, we have just hung out at home, gone to church, and crossed some errands off of our list. This weekend has felt long and stretched out in the best of ways!</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Someday-Maybe-A-Novel/dp/0345532740" target="_blank">Someday, Someday, Maybe</a> by Lauren Graham. I plan to finish it by tomorrow. I&#8217;m really enjoying it! It was hard for me to put it down to do other things this morning. If you are looking for a fun &#8220;beach&#8221; read, this is a good choice!</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>posts about our Europe trip. So much to share!</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to some Ed Sheeran. Looking forward to his new album coming out soon!</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I&#8217;m enjoying this warm yet cool spring weather. I&#8217;m afraid the intense heat is going to be here too soon though&#8230;. The only time I really like that kind of heat is when I&#8217;m at the beach or at the pool. Otherwise, it just makes me tired and unmotivated to do anything but nap.</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  this iced Oprah Chai Tea Latte. I tried the hot version before and really liked it, but for some reason this iced version is just too sweet to me. That&#8217;s unfortunate&#8230;. Might have to get my usual here in a minute &#8211; grande Blonde roast with half and half.</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to be motivated to clean off my dresser after small group tonight</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>jeans and a Baylor t-shirt (Sic &#8216;Em!)</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> the weekend!</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to wish my friends that are getting married this month a big congratulations! I can&#8217;t attend most of the weddings, but I am a bridesmaid in one in a couple of weeks for one of my closest friends! Excited for the wedding festivities.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> a jacket. It&#8217;s a little chilly in Starbucks today. This iced coffee is not helping.<br />

<p><em>Feeling</em>  refreshed. And excited about what summer will bring.</p>
