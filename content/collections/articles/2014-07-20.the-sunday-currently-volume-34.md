<p>Today&#8217;s the day! I&#8217;m changing up my blog design. This will also mean that my blog will no longer be associated with www.everydayaccountsblog.com. You can find me at www.everydayaccountsblog.com for every post after this one. If you currently follow me on Bloglovin at my wordpress.com site,<a href="http://www.bloglovin.com/blog/11840161/?claim=fpbmphttdyn" target="_blank"> follow my new blog with Bloglovin here</a>.</p>
<p>Daniel and I just got back from a quick one-night trip to Gettysburg. Yesterday we spent the afternoon doing a self-guided auto tour of the Civil War battlefields. We picked up our CDs at the Visitor Center Gift Shop. The tour took about three hours long if you add up the time spent stopping and looking at sites as well as the driving between stops and listening to the audio on the CD. It was pretty fascinating.</p>
<p>Downtown Gettysburg is really cute. We ate at a couple of fun restaurants while we were there. We also took the opportunity to stay at a cute bed &amp; breakfast, The Inn at White Oak. It was a fabulous stay &#8211; we recommend it!</p>

<h2>Currently…</h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em> Mindy Kaling&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everyone-Hanging-Without-Other-Concerns/dp/0307886271" target="_blank">Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns)</a>. I plan to finally wrap this one up this afternoon. I didn&#8217;t take too much time to read this past week.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>nothing but this post until after I take a nap. Maybe I&#8217;ll be inspired to work on more blog posts after my nap&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to nothing but the clicking of my keyboard and Daniel typing on his keyboard. It&#8217;s pretty quiet in the apartment today.</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I can&#8217;t decide if I like the new color on my nails. I decided to try Essie&#8217;s Sand Tropez for a natural nude look, but I&#8217;m not sure if I like it or not.</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> my Caribbean Escape candle again! I love this candle.</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to have a productive week at work. That fall deadline is creeping up very, very quickly, and I don&#8217;t want to have a stressful busy season this fall</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>a cotton sundress from Old Navy</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> this gorgeous weather. DC humidity, stay away! I could really love summer if it always felt this way.</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>a nap. I have not been taking many naps lately, but right now it sounds so good to curl up and snooze away for an hour (or two).</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to get to organizing my jewelry stash! I have the tools, I just need to make the time. Perhaps I should do that instead of take that nap. Nah, I need the nap&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>relaxed. Sunday afternoons at home are so good.</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>on Bloglovin&#8217;, Instagram, Twitter&#8230;. It&#8217;s a social media overindulgence kind of day.</p>
