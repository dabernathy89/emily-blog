<p>Today is the day I leave for Memphis for work with a one-way ticket. I will likely be there only two weeks, but it&#8217;s still strange to go without a set return date. My flight is at 7pm tonight, so I&#8217;ve got tons to do before I leave. This stack of magazines is my reading material while I&#8217;m there. Most nights, I&#8217;ll be too exhausted to read a book, but I&#8217;m hoping to at least be able to flip through some magazine pages before bed.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading</em>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Where-Leave-You-Novel/dp/0452296366/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390767800&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=where+i+leave+you" target="_blank">This is Where I Leave You</a> by Jonathan Topper and trying to catch up on this mountain of magazines that has been waiting for me</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>Daniel&#8217;s birthday and Valentine&#8217;s Day cards. I&#8217;m definitely missing his birthday (the 13th) and might be missing Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p><em>Listening </em>to a Pandora station based off of Kelly Clarkson&#8217;s <em>Dark Side </em>(such a beautiful song!)</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>I&#8217;m looking forward to a late brunch with Daniel at Rustico today. We have eaten dinner there a couple times and have always wanted to try their brunch because their dinner is so good!</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  my Anthropologie Sweet Vanilla Cinnamon candle that my sister-in-law gave me for Christmas. Yum!</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> for more time at home before leaving for Memphis</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>that this day does not rush by too quickly</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>pajama pants and a comfy, over-sized t-shirt</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>my husband and snuggly kitty. Oh, and my fun new Lush products I purchased yesterday to bring on my trip with me. Thanks to my sister Ellen for the gift card!</p>
<p><em>Wanting </em>a second cup of coffee, but I&#8217;m saving that for brunch</p>
<p><em>Needing  </em>to do one more load of laundry, to do our tax return, to finish putting together Daniel&#8217;s gift, to run to Target, to pack for two weeks</p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  meh&#8230; I&#8217;m going to miss my little family!</p>
<p><em>Clicking </em> Turbo Tax and a couple Bloglovin&#8217; posts<a href="https://twitter.com/siddathornton"><br />
