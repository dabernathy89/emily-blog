<p>Happy Summer! While summer is not typically one of my favorite seasons, there are so many things about it that I really enjoy: bright colors, pool time, vacations, summer reads, sundresses, cold drinks, etc. We celebrated summer by eating crepes for Saturday brunch at a French cafe in Old Town, attending a going away party for a friend in our church small group last night, participating in the <a href="http://curehhtteamwalkdc.causevox.com/" target="_blank">Cure HHT Walk</a> in DC this morning, and enjoying a tasty tex-mex lunch at Austin Grill (after which I may have squeezed in a nap). Now for a night in of blogging, reading, and possibly watching another episode of True Detective.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Fault-Stars-John-Green/dp/0525478817" target="_blank">The Fault in Our Stars</a>. I have not read it before, and I am determined to read it before seeing the movie. So far, it&#8217;s really great, and it will be a quick read for sure. I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Out-The-Easy-Ruta-Sepetys/dp/039925692X" target="_blank">Out of the Easy</a> earlier this week &#8211; I really enjoyed reading the book, but I thought that the ending was too sudden like the author was rushing to finish it. I would definitely still recommend it as a good summer read though.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>a posting plan in my planner. I&#8217;m really behind on some blog posts I had hoped to do at this point, but all of my traveling has kept me from my plan. Even though I&#8217;ve got some more travel in the near future, I&#8217;m going to try to stick with my plan from here on out.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to Ed Sheeran on Pandora. I&#8217;m really looking forward to his new album that comes out tomorrow!</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I&#8217;m determined to get back into a work-out routine this week. I love going to classes at my gym, but I&#8217;m realizing that I&#8217;m way too dependent on them for my workouts. If I can&#8217;t make a certain class time, then I just won&#8217;t work out that day. There are too many great alternatives for me to make this my excuse &#8211; I have seen so many blog posts about fun at-home workout options lately that I need to start taking advantage of. Do you have any specific suggestions for workout DVDs or YouTube channels that I should start with?</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  our Cinnamon Sugared Donut candle from Bath &amp; Body Works. It&#8217;s almost out, and that is the last of our candles. For now&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>that I don&#8217;t regret the rather large Bath &amp; Body Works online purchase I just made. They are having their Semi-Annual Sale which means their three wick candles are half off and their bath and body products are buy-two-get-one-free. I couldn&#8217;t resist some of their new amazing summer fragrances, and, like I mentioned in &#8220;smelling&#8221; above, we are almost out of candles!</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>comfy shorts and a t-shirt</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> this relaxed summer weekend at home</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to figure out what&#8217;s for dinner tonight. Daniel ran to Trader Joe&#8217;s for our groceries for the week, and we have quite the fun selection of dinner items to choose from.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> a bit more motivation tonight. I feel like being lazy and just watching TV and YouTube, but I can&#8217;t!<br />

<p><em>Feeling</em>  kind of strange. It was a good weekend, but I still feel like I have not gotten enough done at this point. Trying not to be too hard on myself&#8230;.</p>
