<p>We got back from Charleston very, very early yesterday morning on the train. We took a really long nap when we got home and started moving around noon &#8211; unpacking, cleaning, reading, etc. After running some errands, we went to see the new X-Men movie, and then we went to bed early. It probably wasn&#8217;t the most exciting Memorial Day, but we were making up for having a very exciting past few weeks! I love traveling and being busy, but it will be nice to have a few weeks at home with a bit more down time than usual. Hopefully, that means I can work more on these goals!</p>
<h1>Last Week</h1>
<p style="color:#404040;">1. <strong style="font-style:inherit;">Finish <a style="font-weight:inherit;font-style:inherit;color:#278dbc;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Bittersweet-Thoughts-Change-Grace-Learning/dp/0310328160" target="_blank">Bittersweet: Thoughts on Change, Grace, and Learning the Hard Way</a> &#8211; </strong> Done! This book was so great. I loved every page! It really makes you think about the important things in life.</p>
<p style="color:#404040;">2. <strong style="font-style:inherit;">Organize and edit vacation photos. </strong>Nope. I&#8217;m going to try to this weekend.</p>
<p style="color:#404040;">3. <strong style="font-style:inherit;">Get back to the gym! </strong>I did alright, but I still want to get back to being consistent.</p>
<h1>This Week</h1>
<p>1.<strong> Read most (if not all) of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Someday-Maybe-A-Novel/dp/0345532740" target="_blank">Someday, Someday, Maybe</a> as my next book in the <a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/05/01/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge/" target="_blank">summer reading challenge</a>.</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Organize and edit vacation photos. </strong>Gotta try this again! I&#8217;m hoping to start my vacation recap posts end of this week, but I need to edit photos first.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Clean/organize the top of our dresser.</strong> It is so messy because I&#8217;ve been using it as a place to store all of the random things in my purse and suitcase from our trips.</p>
<p>Have a great four-day week!</p>
