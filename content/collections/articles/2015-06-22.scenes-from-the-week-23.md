<p>Happy Monday! Welcome to&nbsp;my Scenes From the Week series. In these quick posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events.</p>
<p><a href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BIRU-WP-20150621T201245GMT-0500.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4448" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BIRU-WP-20150621T201245GMT-0500.jpg" alt="6/21/15" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BIRU-WP-20150621T201245GMT-0500.jpg 1024w, https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BIRU-WP-20150621T201245GMT-0500-150x150.jpg 150w, https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BIRU-WP-20150621T201245GMT-0500-300x300.jpg 300w, https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BIRU-WP-20150621T201245GMT-0500-630x630.jpg 630w, https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BIRU-WP-20150621T201245GMT-0500-600x600-cropped.jpg 600w, https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BIRU-WP-20150621T201245GMT-0500-800x800.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Clockwise starting at the top left:</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;For Fathers&#8217; Day, we all surprised my grandparents by taking them to lunch at the Baylor Club in the new Baylor stadium. After a delicious meal, we walked around part of the stadium for a minute. It was really exciting to see inside. We hope to attend a game there in the fall!</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp;In case you haven&#8217;t heard, it&#8217;s been a bit wet in Texas. I got this picture walking back to my apartment from a coffee run. The clouds over our apartment building&nbsp;looked eerie! I wish clouds showed up better in pictures.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp;We have had Dairy Queen gift cards sitting around since Christmas, so we decided to indulge in a DQ treat. I got the plain vanilla, and Daniel got their Jurassic Smash Blizzard. I love the texture of their ice cream! So creamy and delicious.</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp;Friday we went out for Mexican at a place we hadn&#8217;t tried before, Curra&#8217;s Grill. I had heard so much about their avocado margarita, so I just had to try it! I was scared it would taste like an avocado (love them but don&#8217;t want to drink them), but it didn&#8217;t at all. The avocado just makes the regular margarita creamier and even more flavorful. I will be back for another!</p>

<li>Tuesday everyone in Austin prepared for tropical storm Bill by leaving work early, but he never came to us. It was back to work as usual on Wednesday.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m slowly finishing up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Nightingale-Kristin-Hannah/dp/0312577222" target="_blank">The Nightingale</a> and just loving it. It&#8217;s about time to pick out a new book which is always fun. Any recommendations for a good summer read? I&#8217;m considering another Liane Moriarty book or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Station-Eleven-Emily-John-Mandel/dp/0804172447" target="_blank">Station Eleven</a>.</li>
<li>We drove to Waco Saturday afternoon for Fathers&#8217; Day celebrations with my family! Saturday night I went to see Jurassic Park (again) with my dad since everyone else in the family had already seen it. I still liked it a lot the second time. Sunday we went to church, had brunch at the Baylor Club, and played Ticket to Ride before heading back to Austin. It was such a nice time seeing my dad, mom, sister Ellen, brother Ben, my grandparents, and my uncle.</li>

<p>I hope that everyone had a great Fathers&#8217; Day weekend! As you can see, we sure did. I have such an amazing father, and I&#8217;m so happy to live such a short drive away from my family.</p>
<p>Happy Monday! Have a great week!</p>
