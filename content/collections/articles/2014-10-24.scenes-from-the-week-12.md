<p>Happy Friday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts I share the highlights from my week &#8211; ranging from memorable events to the small things that made me smile.</p>
<h1>Monday</h1>
<p>Monday was low-key. We unpacked from our weekend trip. I can&#8217;t remember what we did for the rest of the evening, but I&#8217;m pretty sure we went to bed early.</p>
<h1>Tuesday</h1>
<p>Tuesday we met our good friends Kaitlin &amp; Erik for dinner at Del Ray Pizzaria. We stuffed our faces with delicious pizza while catching up on life &#8211; we hadn&#8217;t gotten together in a while. After pizza, we went for milkshakes at the place next door.</p>
<h1>Wednesday</h1>
<p>Daniel and I applied for Global Entry, a pass that gets you through the customs line much more quickly when returning from an international trip. We decided to apply now because we are taking a couple of domestic flights soon, and once you get your Global Entry pass, you also get TSA PreCheck which allows you to basically skip the security line at any airport that participates. The Global Entry pass costs $100 and is good for five years! I&#8217;m very excited to have easier travel over the next few years. 🙂</p>
<p>After that I filled out my absentee ballot application since I&#8217;m going to be out of town for work on election day. I guess I was just feeling productive Wednesday evening!</p>
<h1>Thursday</h1>
<p>I made a new fall playlist and listened to it on repeat at work. The playlist includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcA5-DIKHio" target="_blank">this song</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK9WdglqBis" target="_blank">this song</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZAs5K7L8KA" target="_blank">this song</a>.</p>
<p>After work I met up with my book club to watch The Fault in Our Stars movie. I can&#8217;t believe I hadn&#8217;t already seen it! I did not like the first half, but I really liked the second half. Yes, there were tears&#8230;.</p>
<p>When I got home I had lots of snuggles with this cutie&#8230;.</p>

<p>&#8230;.and then headed to bed!</p>
<p>Have a fantastic weekend! My in-laws are coming to town, and we have lots of fun touristy DC plans in store!</p>
