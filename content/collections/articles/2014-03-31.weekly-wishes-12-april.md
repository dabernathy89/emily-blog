<p>Each Monday night, I link up with <a href="http://thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to share my &#8220;wishes&#8221; or goals for the week and to see how I did on my goals last week. For Weekly Wishes at the beginning of each month, instead of setting goals for the week, we set goals for the month.</p>
<h1>Last Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Read half of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Cuckoos-Calling-Robert-Galbraith/dp/0316206849" target="_blank">The Cuckoo&#8217;s Calling</a>.</strong> I&#8217;m only about a third of the way through.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Tackle the dresser to continue spring cleaning. </strong>I did not get to this.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Start thinking about and planning the next steps for my blog. </strong>I did start thinking about it, but I haven&#8217;t put pen to paper.</p>
<p>I kind of failed all of these. When I wasn&#8217;t busy at work, I was attending a conference at church, and I just did not have a lot of spare time.</p>
<h1>April Goals</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Finish my February and March Project Life layouts. </strong>I am most of the way through my February layout, but I haven&#8217;t picked it back up for a few weeks.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Wrap up our plans for London and Paris! </strong>We leave May 7th, and I am counting down the days. I&#8217;m a big planner, so I definitely want to have our &#8220;must-dos&#8221; planned out before going. BUT it is always important to me to leave plenty of time to just roam around and explore the city, so I need to be careful not to over-plan.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Get into the habit of taking walks. </strong>I do believe that today is the first of many spring days to finally reach the DC area. After April 15th, when I&#8217;m back to a normal work schedule, I really want to get out a couple of weekdays each week to enjoy the fresh air.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Read two books. </strong>This is a goal of mine every month.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Go through all my clothes (in my closet, drawers, and storage bins) and get rid of or donate everything I do not wear. </strong>Last summer, I turned all of the clothes hangers backwards, and ever since then, I&#8217;ve been turning the hangers of clothes I wear forwards so that I can easily see what I haven&#8217;t worn for a full year.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Write 4 letters to loved ones. </strong>Writing letters was one of my weekly goals a couple of weeks ago, and it made me really want to get in the habit of writing them.</p>
