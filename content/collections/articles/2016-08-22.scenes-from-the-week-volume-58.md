<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.<a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SFTW_58.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7455" src="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SFTW_58-1024x1024.jpg" alt="SFTW_58" width="1024" height="1024" data-wp-pid="7455" srcset="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SFTW_58-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SFTW_58-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SFTW_58-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SFTW_58-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SFTW_58-800x800.jpg 800w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SFTW_58-630x630.jpg 630w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SFTW_58-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SFTW_58-1200x1200-cropped.jpg 1200w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SFTW_58.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>We had a very laid-back and enjoyable week and weekend at home. We went to some of our favorite local spots and tried several new ones as well. We read, watched shows, cooked, completed a home project, and ran errands. Weekends like these make me fall in love with Austin more and more!</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Sometimes when we are out of town all weekend, we schedule a Blue Apron order to arrive for the following week&#8217;s meals. Since we were in New Orleans last weekend, we did that for this week and made a few delicious meals including Chilled Chicken Ramen and Veggies and Seared Cod with Summer Succotash. They were all healthy and yummy meals! I actually have free meals to hand out to anyone who is interested. Let me know if you&#8217;d like a free shipment of Blue Apron to try out, and I can give you the code. I got started with Blue Apron by using someone else&#8217;s code &#8211; it really is free! <em>{P.S. I am not sponsored by Blue Apron in any way.} </em>I also made a really great zoodle recipe this week. I took a recipe for Cacio e Pepe from a cookbook and switched out the pasta for zucchini noodles I made with my spiralizer! I definitely love real pasta, but it&#8217;s nice to be able to eat a big bowl full of &#8220;pasta&#8221; and not feel guilty. Zucchini really does well as a pasta replacement.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">(2) My baby brother moved into college this week. I wasn&#8217;t able to be there for move-in day, but my dad sent me this picture. I&#8217;m so happy for him to be the next Baylor Bear in the family, but I teared up a little when I saw it. How did he grow up so quickly?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">(3) We finally put up my travel wall project! We have had a giant blank wall above our couch ever since we moved to Austin, and I&#8217;ve been planning to do this project for a long time. I finally got all of the materials I needed and made it happen this weekend. I used <a href="http://www.thecreativityexchange.com/2014/09/diy-framed-calendar-prints.html" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> to turn a Rifle Paper Company calendar into artwork for the wall. I love it so much! I&#8217;ve decided to add two more frames to each side since the six I&#8217;ve chosen don&#8217;t take up as much wall space as I expected. I&#8217;ll probably go buy the four extra frames this weekend. But I&#8217;m just happy the majority of it is hanging on the wall now!</span></p>
<p>(4) I discovered my new favorite sparkling water &#8211; Topo Chico with a twist of of lime! You can find Topo Chico all over Austin, but I had never seen a flavored version before. I love La Croix and will continue to still buy it and drink it (especially the coconut flavor!), but Topo Chico&#8217;s lime definitely beats La Croix&#8217;s lime. It&#8217;s a much stronger flavor.</p>

<li>Lots of time spent reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Life-Violet-Grant/dp/0425274845/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471814194&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+secret+life+of+violet+grant" target="_blank">this book</a>. I love it!</li>
<li>Dinner with my sister and Jason Friday night</li>
<li>Going to see the new Star Trek movie (I thought it was good!)</li>
<li>Finishing the show Stranger Things. It was really good although it left me confused at the end. My favorite parts were the music and the child actors.</li>
<li>Brunch at one of our local favorites &#8211; Odd Duck</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m continuing to share mini guides on places we stopped along our big Europe backpacking trip, and this week I shared our <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2016/08/travel-with-me-one-day-in-cannes/" target="_blank">one day in Cannes </a>with a stop in Antibes along the way. The French Riviera is stunning!</li>
<li>I created a Facebook page for my blog. It needs some work, but feel free to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/everydayaccounts/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel" target="_blank">follow along</a> here.</li>

<p>Have a great week!</p>
