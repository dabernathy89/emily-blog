<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Month series!  In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous month ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have babies, everyday moments are extra special!</p>
<p>June was great. The celebrations from May continued on. In the middle of the month, my sister and brother-in-law (Ellen and Lane) celebrated their one year wedding anniversary with the big wedding celebration/reception they were supposed to have in 2020. It was so much fun to celebrate this beautiful couple! And we ended the month with a girls&#8217; weekend at my parents&#8217; house (Mom, Ellen, Elizabeth, and me), and a guys&#8217; weekend at our house (Dad, Daniel, Carson, Caden, and Ben).</p>
<h2>Favorites from the Month:</h2>
<p><em>{This section contains some Amazon affiliate links.}</em></p>
<p><strong>Fiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/3wdl613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Last Thing He Told Me</a> by Laura Dave. While I wasn&#8217;t impressed by the whole book, it did keep me reading and interested, and it had somewhat of a different storyline than other thrillers I&#8217;ve been reading lately.</p>
<p><strong>Nonfiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/2TvB899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Share Your Stuff. I&#8217;ll Go First.: 10 Questions to Take Your Friendships to the Next Level</a> by Laura Tremaine. I really enjoyed this book. A dear friend recommended it, and it really challenged me to think about my true friendships and how to grow them into something even more special. I love how Laura writes and tells her stories.</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> &#8211; I feel like I&#8217;m too old to admit this, but I&#8217;ve been enjoying a few of Olivia Rodrigo&#8217;s songs. They are so moody and take me back to those strong high school emotions, ha!</p>
<p><strong>Movie/TV</strong> &#8211; We watched <a href="https://amzn.to/3dG0JmN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">True Detective Season 3</a>. It was really well-done but super slow, and the ending was a little disappointing. I much preferred the couple episodes of <em>This is Us</em> that we watched. That season finale&#8230;. oh my&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Item</strong> &#8211; My <a href="https://amzn.to/3dDQjnB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new massager</a>. I have been using it most nights to get those knots out. It is very intense, and I really like a deep massage. However, even I can only do the slowest setting! It&#8217;s a super relaxing nightly ritual.</p>
<p><strong>Activity</strong> &#8211; Ellen&#8217;s wedding celebration weekend!</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishment</strong> &#8211; Taking the boys solo to the pool for the first time. This felt like a huge win! I had been nervous to try it, but I needed to since I&#8217;m not sure what else we will do outdoors during the day during the hot, hot Texas summer.</p>

It was a wonderful way to kick off wedding weekend.</p>
<p>(2) We stayed at The Adolphus in Dallas for the wedding weekend. This is Abuela, Carson, &amp; Caden enjoying the view from their room.</p>
<p>(3) I got a quick cuddle in with my big boy during some of the first dances at the wedding celebration.</p>
<p>(4) My little boy really got into it on the dance floor!</p>

We had so much fun together eating out,</p>
<p>(2) getting manis &amp; pedis, shopping, and re-creating a classic photo for our grandma (see bottom of post!).</p>
<p>(3) Meanwhile, the guys had a great time in Austin swimming&#8230;</p>
<p>(4) &#8230;playing frisbee golf, and playing lots of board games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFTM_June-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_4.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12028" src="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFTM_June-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_4.png" alt="SFTM_June 2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com" width="940" height="788" srcset="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFTM_June-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_4.png 940w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFTM_June-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_4-300x251.png 300w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFTM_June-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_4-768x644.png 768w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SFTM_June-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_4-640x537.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></a>(1) After the wedding weekend in Dallas, Abuelo &amp; Abuela took Caden home with them, and Carson got time alone with Mommy &amp; Daddy at home! I tried to make it a fun week for him. On the way home from Dallas, we paid Uncle Terry a visit at his dental practice in Waco and admired his office train&#8230;</p>
<p>(2) we went to a big inflatable play place that Carson fondly refers to as &#8220;the comfy play cafe&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>(3) and we went to The Thinkery (an interactive children&#8217;s museum) and out for ice cream one day too.</p>
<p>(4) Carson had a dentist appointment, and it was the first one where he got to sit in the &#8220;grown up&#8221; dental chair. He did such a great job! He is one of the few people in the world who gets excited to go to the dentist. Both the dentist and I were surprised that he sat still through both his X-rays and his cleaning! I was a proud Mama!</p>
<p>Now, back to the classic photo my sisters and I recreated. Elizabeth had the great idea to re-make the photo that our grandmother (&#8220;Mama Dee&#8221;) used in her square dancing shop many years ago to model her children&#8217;s dress-up clothes. Mama Dee is not feeling very well, so we wanted to make her smile. Elizabeth found all the pieces to recreate the costumes, and I think it turned out great. Mama Dee was so happy to see it. How do you think we did?<br />
