<p>Each Monday night, I link up with <a href="http://thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to share my &#8220;wishes&#8221; or goals for the week and to see how I did on my goals last week.</p>
<p>This is going to be a short post. Those of you who read my posts regularly have heard me say this a million times (and are probably quite sick of it), but I&#8217;m counting down the days until April 15th is over! For those who don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m a tax accountant, so things have been quite busy at the office. I&#8217;m so so so excited to have more time to do the things I enjoy doing outside of work.</p>
<h1>This Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Read as much as I can. </strong>I&#8217;m still on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Cuckoos-Calling-Robert-Galbraith/dp/0316206849" target="_blank">The Cuckoo&#8217;s Calling</a>, and I&#8217;m going really slow, but that&#8217;s okay until 4/15! I&#8217;ll just read what I can.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Put together an outfit from my closet for our spring pictures in DC.</strong> My wedding photographer is coming to town, so we have a photo session scheduled in the city Saturday! I bought a few new makeup products for the pictures, but I&#8217;m going to put together an outfit from things already in my closet. Wish me luck!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for this week! I&#8217;ll be back in full-swing with personal hobbies and goals next week!</p>
