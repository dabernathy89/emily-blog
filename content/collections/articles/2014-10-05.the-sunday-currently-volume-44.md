<p>Happy Sunday! It has been a very relaxed weekend for us. I&#8217;m noticing that all of my TSC posts should probably be called &#8220;What We Ate This Weekend&#8221; posts since I&#8217;m always taking pictures of my food and sharing that here! What can I say? We love to eat and we love to go out to restaurants on the weekend. 🙂</p>
<p>Friday we went to one of our favorite Mexican places around here &#8211; El Guapo. It was delicious as always.</p>
<p>Saturday morning I spent the first hour doing two of my favorite things &#8211; cuddling with Banana and reading a book (with a hot mug of coffee, of course).</p>

<p>After that, I made it to Body Pump. I&#8217;m going to be really sore soon because it has been awhile since I made it to that class, and I have never felt soreness like I do when I resume going back to Body Pump&#8230;. But it was so nice to get in a workout before the day really got started. After showering, we cleaned up around the apartment and got a few things done before heading into DC to have dinner at Hill Country! This is a Texas BBQ restuarant with a really fun atmosphere. Daniel found a Travelzoo deal that got us a whole lot of food for a significant discount.  It was so good!</p>

<p>After dinner we decided to cross one thing off of our DC Bucket List &#8211; visiting the Politics &amp; Prose bookstore! We had never been before because it is a bit of a drive from where we live, but we have wanted to ever since we heard about it. It was a great little shop full of all kinds of books. There was a heavy emphasis on political and history books as well as biographies &#8211; while I don&#8217;t typically read books like that (I wish I did!), those are Daniel&#8217;s books of choice, so he was in paradise. After making a few selections (an early start to Christmas shopping), we headed to the bookstore coffee shop to read for an hour.</p>

<p>This morning we went to church and had leftover BBQ for lunch. I baked some <a href="http://mixandmatchmama.blogspot.com/2013/09/bar-6-pumpkin-pie-snickerdoodle.html" target="_blank">Pumpkin Pie Snickerdoodle bars</a> for our small group dinner tonight. They smell delicious, but I&#8217;ll have to get back to you on the verdict once we try them! Now we are working on some things at Barnes &amp; Noble, and then we will head one to our small group dinner.</p>

<p>Now onto what The Sunday Currently is meant to be, a glimpse into the current moment on the best day of the week.</p>
<p><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></p>
<p><em>Reading  </em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Happiness-Pursuit-Finding-Purpose/dp/0385348843#" target="_blank">The Happiness of Pursuit</a> by Chris Guillebeau still, but I&#8217;m almost done. I&#8217;m also listening to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Night-Circus-Erin-Morgenstern/dp/0307744434#" target="_blank">The Night Circus</a> by <span class="author notFaded" data-width=""><span class="a-declarative" data-action="a-popover" data-a-popover="{&quot;position&quot;:&quot;triggerBottom&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;contributor-info-B004U5WA68&quot;,&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:&quot;true&quot;}">Erin Morgenstern </span></span>on my commute to and from work. That book is a great fall read! I love the magic and the mystery and the beautiful descriptions.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>in my journal and posts for the blog. Earlier I wrote some very powerful sermon notes this morning while listening to our pastor that I hope to reference later. Also, I recently wrote out our meal plan for the week.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to general coffee shop sounds &#8211; coffee brewing, lattes and cappucinos being made, people having conversations, keyboards clacking, pages turning</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I&#8217;m having another one of those days where I&#8217;m really missing family. Good thing we are heading to Texas in two weeks!</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> coffee and books, my favorites scents</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>that we are doing what we are called to be doing. A lot is going to be happening in the coming months, and I&#8217;m a bit nervous about the future.</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>jeans and one of my new favorite long-sleeve t-shirts from Target</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>this slow Sunday afternoon</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to re-paint my nails. I&#8217;m new to painting my finger nails. I really like it because it keeps me from biting my nails (a terrible habit I&#8217;ve always had), but it requires a little more maintenance than I had expected.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to get in a few morning workouts this week</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>ready to conquer a busy week. I know I talk about being busy with work a lot (sorry about that), but I have another deadline coming up on October 15th. It&#8217;s not nearly as bad as the last one, and thankfully, once this one is over I won&#8217;t be too busy until after December.</p>
<p><em>Clicking </em>around the<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.artifactuprising.com/site/home" target="_blank">Artifact Uprising</a><strong> </strong>website making our photo book for our trip we took in May</p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
