<p>I hardly ever talk about beauty and makeup on my blog. That&#8217;s because I am by no means an expert in that area, and  I really don&#8217;t consider that it to be a priority in my life. However, I do really enjoy the beauty world, and applying my makeup in the mornings is one of the most relaxing things that I do to start my day.</p>
<p>I started getting into experimenting with makeup a little over a year ago. Currently, I have a routine that I just really, really enjoy, so I thought I&#8217;d share the products with you. I use a mix of drugstore and high-end products. I know that this list is quite lengthy. I do wear a lot of products, but I try to make them as natural looking as I can. These are the products I&#8217;m wearing this summer nearly every day.</p>

<h3>CoverGirl Outlast Stay Fabulous 3-in-1 Foundation</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried a lot of new foundations lately, but I keep coming back to <a href="http://amzn.to/2ixCjj4" target="_blank">this one</a>. It has been a favorite of mine since last summer. I think I&#8217;m done trying out new foundations since this one is so great, and I really have no reason to try out anything new. It blends very nicely into my skin, stays on all day, and allows me to have control over the coverage.</p>
<h3>Maybelline FIT Me! Concealer</h3>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2jRi81h" target="_blank">This concealer</a> covers my very dark circles under my eyes and lasts all day.</p>
<h3>Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Dark Circles Eraser</h3>
<p>I use the <a href="http://amzn.to/2ixFAix" target="_blank">brightener shade</a>. While I don&#8217;t think this completely covers my dark circles like the FIT Me! concealer does, I like how it brightens any area it&#8217;s applied to. I usually put it under my eyes, on the bridge of my nose, and on my chin.</p>
<h3>Tarte Smooth Operator Amazonian Clay Finishing Powder</h3>
<p>While <a href="http://amzn.to/2jjy37W" target="_blank">this powder</a> is really messy and gets everywhere when I apply it, it does such a good job of keeping my makeup looking great all day that I think it&#8217;s worth it to deal with the mess. The white powder is easily blended into the skin.</p>
<h3>The Balm&#8217;s Mary-Lou Manizer</h3>
<p>I use <a href="http://amzn.to/2jKfXbW" target="_blank">this</a> for a little bit of highlighting on my cheeks.</p>
<h3>The Body Shop&#8217;s Bronzing Powder</h3>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2jjJXyV" target="_blank">This</a> is barely a bronzer. In fact, I&#8217;ve heard many people say they hate it because it doesn&#8217;t do anything on their skin. I love it because I&#8217;m a very fair-skinned person, so this product makes it very easy to give myself a little bit of color without overdoing it.</p>
<h3>Milani Baked Blush in Luminoso</h3>
<p>I can&#8217;t say enough good things about the Milani Baked Blushes! The <a href="http://amzn.to/2jK8wl6" target="_blank">Luminoso shade</a> is a light peachy shade with a little bit of shimmer. I have really enjoyed wearing it in the summertime.</p>
<h3>Anastasia Brow Wiz</h3>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2isMUso" target="_blank">This eyebrow pencil</a> in combination with the <a href="http://amzn.to/2jKaPEL" target="_blank">Milani Brow Shaping Clear Gel</a> below is the eyebrow solution I had been looking for for a long time. I have very sparse eyebrows, so the pencil fills them in while still looking very natural, and the brow gel holds my naturally curly brows in place.</p>
<h3>Milani Brow Shaping Clear Gel</h3>
<p>See above.</p>
<h3>Too Faced Shadow Insurance in Champagne</h3>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2jjHhkP" target="_blank">This eyeshadow primer</a> is just beautiful. It has a nice light pink and shimmery shade, so I sometimes wear it by itself without any other shadow. When I do wear it with other eye shadows, it keeps the shadow from creasing all day.</p>
<h3>Urban Decay Eyeshadow in Sin</h3>
<p>This is a light and shimmery purple eye shadow. I love using it as a base on my eyelids or under my brows.</p>
<h3>Stila In the Light Eyeshadow Palette</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using and loving this palette for a long time now. You can see from the picture below which shades I use on an almost daily basis (Bare, Kitten, Bliss, and Bubbly). To me, these shades in combination with Urban Decay Sin and the Too Faced Shadow Insurance (and sometimes a little bit of Sunset from this palette) make the perfect daily look to wear to work.</p>

<h3>Lorac Unzipped Eyeshadow Palette</h3>
<p>A few months ago, I ordered <a href="http://amzn.to/2jjMXuV" target="_blank">this palette</a> to try out. While I still use the Stila palette above more often, I love to pull out this Lorac palette for the days I want a more dramatic look or for when I&#8217;m going out in the evenings. The colors in this palette sure are pretty!</p>

<h3>Urban Decay 24-7 Glide-On Eye Pencil in Sabbath</h3>
<p>The shade Sabbath is a navy color. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed wearing navy eye liner in the summer since it is lighter and less harsh than black eye liner.</p>
<h3>Benefit&#8217;s Roller Lash Mascara</h3>
<p>I purchased <a href="http://amzn.to/2ixwpP4" target="_blank">this mascara</a> last month, and it is my new all-time favorite mascara. It doesn&#8217;t clump my lashes at all, and it is easy to control how dramatic the look is. I can easily wear it very naturally with one to two coats or make it fancier with a few more coats.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my summer makeup routine! Let me know if you have any favorite summer makeup staples in the comments below. While I try not to spend too much on makeup, I do love to try out new products occasionally, so I&#8217;ll look out for some good suggestions!</p>
