<p>To me, the holiday season started yesterday. Try not to judge! I saw <a href="http://www.maiedae.com/" target="_blank">a favorite blog of mine</a> put it this way, &#8220;Some people would say November 1st is too early and I would say two months of Christmas is better than one!&#8221; I am just SO HAPPY!! I love how we still have a whole month left of fall, Thanksgiving is just around the corner, and little glimpses of the holiday season are already showing up everywhere. This weekend, I have seen it in my Starbucks red cup, the Christmas decorations at Target, and throughout different blog posts that I have been reading. Is anyone else excited with me?</p>
<p><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></p>
<p><em>Reading  </em> a lot of different things actually. I started and finished the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/We-Were-Liars-E-Lockhart/dp/038574126X" target="_blank">We Were Liars</a> audio book this week, and I really really enjoyed the story. I am just now starting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Little-Lies-Liane-Moriarty/dp/0399167064/ref=la_B00459IA54_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414952222&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Big Little Lies</a>. And  I&#8217;m about to begin the audio book for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Imaginary-Girls-Nova-Ren-Suma/dp/014242143X" target="_blank">Imaginary Girls</a>, the book selection for the blogger&#8217;s book club hosted by Crystal over at <a href="http://www.dreams-etc.com/" target="_blank">Dreams, etc.</a>!</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>a few blog posts as well as outlining plans for our time in Chicago next weekend! I&#8217;m headed to the suburbs of Chicago tomorrow morning for work training, and Daniel will be joining me on Friday for a touristy weekend in The Windy City! We are very excited, even though it is supposed to be extremely cold.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>&#8230;&#8230;to Pandora Christmas. Just a little Christmas music here and there, nothing too much yet!</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I really need to get most of my packing for the week done soon. We have a full schedule this evening with small group and a concert right afterward in the city.</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> the fun Christmas candle options in Target. Well, I&#8217;m not right now, but I was while we were at Target this morning.</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>for a good week at work training &#8211; I&#8217;m really just looking froward to getting out of the office for a bit</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>jeans and a long sleeved t-shirt and my favorite new cozy scarf</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>my grandparents. I&#8217;ve been trying to be much better about calling them regularly. I love them so much and want to show that to them by calling and hearing how they are doing. One of my grandma&#8217;s is not able to leave the house much, but she is making the most of her situation by quilting baby quilts for children without families.</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to be able to read 100x more quickly than I currently do. I want to read all the books, but there are so many!!</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to try out this new Revlon Gel Envy polish I picked up at Target. No, this is not a real need, but I feel like I need to find a polish that won&#8217;t chip as quickly as normal polish, so this is my first experiment in do-it-yourself gel manicures.</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>excited about lots of fun things coming up soon</p>
<p><em>Clicking </em>through my favorite blogs, of course</p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
