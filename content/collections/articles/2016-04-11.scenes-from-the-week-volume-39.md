<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

It was a pretty good week. I started out my first day with a visit to my favorite place for a healthy lunch near the office, Blenders and Bowls! They serve delicious acai bowls.</p>
<p>(2) Daniel was out of town all week, so I made a spontaneous trip to Waco on Friday to hang out with my family. We made an obligatory stop for Katie&#8217;s Custard after dinner!</p>
<p>(3) Daniel came home late Saturday night after being gone since Monday morning. It was so good to have a nice Sunday together. A day at home together almost always means delicious coffee. On this day he made us coffee from the AeroPress.</p>
<p>(4) We ended the weekend with an evening walk to our favorite bridge on Lady Bird Lake! The lights were just coming on downtown and looked so pretty!</p>

<li>Loving some podcasts: The Happy Hour with Jamie Ivey, The Jess Lively Show, and Donald Miller&#8217;s Building a Story Brand</li>
<li>Finally became a member of the Austin Public Library (yay for free eBooks!)</li>

<p>Have a great week!</p>
