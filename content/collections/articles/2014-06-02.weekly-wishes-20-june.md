<p>Another month gone! May was very good to me. It was a month of traveling and exploring and enjoying things outside of my office after a very long busy season. I&#8217;m happy to say June will be more of some of the same. Here is my goal recap from last week as well as a list of goals for June. I&#8217;m not going to recap my May goals because I pretty much failed all around. I have a problem of forgetting my monthly goals since I&#8217;m focusing on my weekly goals. I need to make them match up a little bit more to help with that.</p>
<h1>Last Week</h1>
<p>1.<strong> Read most (if not all) of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Someday-Maybe-A-Novel/dp/0345532740" target="_blank">Someday, Someday, Maybe</a> as my next book in the <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/05/01/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge/" target="_blank">summer reading challenge</a>. </strong>I just have a few pages left!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Organize and edit vacation photos. </strong>I&#8217;ve finally figured out a photo organization system (somewhat). Our trip photos are almost all organized, but I need to edit still.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Clean/organize the top of our dresser.</strong> The dresser is cleared! It&#8217;s so nice to get that done.</p>
<h1>June Goals</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Read three books. </strong>This was a May goal that I actually accomplished, and I want to do it again!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Actually clean out my closet and get rid of clothes I no longer wear.</strong> This was both an April and a May goal that I kept forgetting about. Hopefully this is the last time I&#8217;ll be listing this as a goal!</p>
<p>3. <strong>Make a game plan for revamping my blog design and layout. </strong>It was always my plan to work on this in the summer, and I&#8217;ve started looking at templates already, but I really want to nail down what changes I want for the blog. Since we have some more traveling this month, I won&#8217;t plan to actually make the changes until July, but I want to do everything I need to do before actually making the change.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Create my April Project Life layout. </strong>I caught up through March last weekend! It was so much fun and reminded me why I wanted to do Project Life in the first place. I&#8217;m even throwing around the idea of creating a separate album just for our recent trip to Europe, but we will see!</p>
<p>5. <strong>Organize my blog feed.</strong> The number of blogs I follow on Bloglovin&#8217; has gotten out of hand. I want to delete the blogs I no longer read and organize the rest into categories such as Daily Reads, Organization, Beauty, etc.</p>
