<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

</a>Not a lot happened during weekdays this past week, but the weekend was very eventful! We flew to DC for our good friends&#8217; wedding and got to see so many friends that we hadn&#8217;t seen since we moved to Austin a little over a year ago. We had a blast celebrating Lauren and Dave!</p>
<p>(1) I took this picture taking off for DC from Austin. I thought it was a pretty gorgeous view of downtown Austin and some of the surrounding countryside. So proud to call this place home!</p>
<p>(2) Our friends Kaitlin and Erik kindly hosted us for the weekend. We had a great dinner together Friday night and enjoyed catching up with them immensely!</p>
<p>(3) Saturday night was wedding time! Lauren and Dave had a really fun guest book where guests take a polaroid and tape it in the book along with a message. It kind of makes me want to get a polaroid camera!</p>
<p>(4) This picture is grainy, and I can&#8217;t fit everyone in the square, but I still love it&#8230;. This is a great group of friends we hung out with at the wedding including the lovely bride in the middle! Most everyone at our reception table worked at EY together in DC (except Daniel), and funnily enough, only me and two of the others are left at the company! It was fun to get together, reminisce on old times, and celebrate!</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had a wonderful leisurely Saturday morning that involved coffee, french toast bake, great conversation, and a nice time window shopping on King Street in Old Town Alexandria.</li>
<li>I finished the book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Alice Forgot</span> on the plane back home. I really enjoyed it and plan to keep reading Liane Moriarty&#8217;s books. I hear she is coming out with a new one this summer!</li>
<li>Sunday morning breakfast was at a new coffee shop in Del Ray (near DC), and they serve &#8220;build-your-own&#8221; biscuits. I had a biscuit with cheese, egg, and smashed avocado. It was mouth-watering!</li>
</ul>
