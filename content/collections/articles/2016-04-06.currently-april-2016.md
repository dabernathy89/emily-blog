<p><strong>Making</strong> | A few yummy recipes! We were determined to start cooking more once we returned from Europe, and we have! We are trying out <a href="http://www.emeals.com" target="_blank">eMeals</a>, a meal planning assistant that sends you recipes and grocery lists each week, and we&#8217;ve made some good recipes from it. [I&#8217;m not sponsored &#8211; just sharing!]</p>
<p><strong>Wishlisting</strong> |<i> </i> Not much. We are on a strict budget after our big trip. I have been eyeing some fun prints to put on the wall above our couch&#8230;. Something fun to think of for the future!</p>
<p><b>Cleaning </b>| Our hardwood floors nearly every day. Banana (our cat) sheds like crazy. He&#8217;s an orange and white cat, so his fur shows up very well on our dark wood floors. That means we vacuum very, very often&#8230;. Maybe I&#8217;ll add a Roomba to &#8220;wishlisting&#8221; above!</p>
<p><strong>Posting </strong>| A lot of travel-related posts! I&#8217;ve been sharing a lot of adventure stories from our Europe backpacking trip as well as tips I&#8217;ve picked up along the way. I&#8217;ve also been sharing snippets from our life at home in Austin as well.</p>
<p><strong>Tasting</strong> | A few pieces of English Ale Cheddar Cheese from Trader Joe&#8217;s. It&#8217;s delicious! We also have some great coconut lime popsicles in our freezer&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Reading</strong> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SI0B5VW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank">Fates &amp; Furies</a> by Lauren Groff. I&#8217;m just getting started, but it&#8217;s good so far!</p>
<p><strong>Watching</strong> | Law &amp; Order: SVU this week. I have a lot of episodes to catch up on, and I find it a very good show to watch while getting other things done. I&#8217;m planning to start Broadchurch on Netflix soon. Have any of you watched it? What did you think?</p>
<p><strong>Listening</strong> | To a few podcasts. Mostly I&#8217;ve been listening to The Happy Hour with Jamie Ivey. I really enjoyed episode 82 with one of my favorite bloggers, Shay Shull at <a href="http://shullfamily.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Mix and Match Family</a>!</p>
