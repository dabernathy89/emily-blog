<p>Happy Sunday! The Sunday Currently started as a fabulous link-up hosted by one of my favorite bloggers. Sadly, the link-up came to an end, but I continue to post TSC posts in order to share a weekend recap and a glimpse into my Sunday. [UPDATE: Since I wrote this post, I found out that another blogger who loves TSC (Kristin over at <a href="http://www.kcsaling.com/" target="_blank">Challenge Accepted</a>) has picked up hosting the link-up! I&#8217;m exciting to continue on with her.]</p>
<p>I was fairly quiet in the blog world this past week. My week was so full of work that I didn&#8217;t feel I had enough content to even write a Scenes From the Week post, so I skipped it altogether. I&#8217;m hoping to pick back up with my content this week even though work will still be taking over my life for the next two weeks. Also, my Bloglovin&#8217; feed is overflowing with great posts that I want to read and comment on, but I&#8217;m not even sure where to start! What do you do whenever your feed is full, and you still want to read everything? Anyway, onto my weekend recap&#8230;.</p>
<p>Friday was date night! We had an early dinner at the new Bonefish Grill location that opened in our area. We actually have had a gift card lying around that we got for Christmas TWO YEARS AGO waiting until we could go to a Bonefish Grill, and it conveniently came to us instead. 🙂 We really enjoyed the food &#8211; there are lots of delicious options on the menu I&#8217;d like to go back and try some time.</p>

<p>After dinner, we went to the movies to see The Giver. We both enjoyed it. Surprisingly, I have never read the book. I had hoped to read it before we saw it in theaters, but that just didn&#8217;t work out. So, I think I was a little bit confused by some things in the movie because I haven&#8217;t read the book, but overall, I do recommend the movie.</p>
<p>Saturday morning and early afternoon I worked from home while occasionally taking a break to organize and clean out our linen closet.  Then Daniel and I went back to our favorite local cafe, Cafe Caturra, for a late lunch. I was really craving their oven-baked mac and cheese, so that&#8217;s exactly what I got! Afterward, we headed over to our church&#8217;s Saturday night service.</p>

<p>Today has been a gloriously relaxing day. Daniel and I woke up and forced ourselves to go to a morning BodyPump class, and then we came home and had pancakes and eggs for an at-home brunch.</p>

<p>We watched some more Homeland, and then I did some reading before going to Barnes and Noble to get some blogging done (with one really great magazine and stuffed pretzel break pictured below).</p>

<p>Next we drove into DC to meet our small group for dinner at a local Mexican cafe! It was a good time with great friends. Now, I&#8217;m going to do my new Sunday night routine &#8211; a face mask and painting my nails. And, no, I don&#8217;t get tomorrow off along with most of the rest of America, but I won&#8217;t wallow in self-pity for too long. 🙂</p>
<p><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></p>
<p><em>Reading  </em> not any book in particular. I&#8217;m thinking I might check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Selection-Kiera-Cass/dp/0062059947/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409528077&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+selection+series" target="_blank">The Selection series</a> next. Have any of you read it?</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>blog posts and travel plans for the Fall/early Winter</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to Homeland on TV. We are zooming through Season 3!</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I wish I could be with my family in Waco, TX now enjoying the opening weekend of the new Baylor stadium</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> our Peach Cilantro candle! Even though it is marketed as a summer candle, peaches remind me of early Fall for some reason. And, I&#8217;m so so so excited for Fall.</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>for a peaceful, productive week. And motivation to keep up with my workout routine.</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>comfy shorts and a t-shirt. I&#8217;m ready for a cozy evening in as this rainstorm begins.</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>Saul in Homeland. He is so fatherly and cool and sweet at the same time! Mandy Patinkin is such a great actor.</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>my <a href="https://www.skinnycow.com/products/detail.aspx?id=44" target="_blank">favorite evening treat</a></p>
<p><em>Needing </em> more hours in the day. There are so many things I want to do in each day, and it&#8217;s just not possible.</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>pretty darn good. I&#8217;m definitely blessed.</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>Instagram, Bloglovin&#8217;, Pinterest. All my usual social media favorites.</p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
