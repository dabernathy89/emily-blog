<p>Our weekends at home seem to be rare these days, so we definitely enjoyed spending time locally this weekend! It was a perfect mix of spending time doing things with friends and relaxation and getting errands done.</p>
<p>(1) Friday we went into DC to do our Global Entry interviews &#8211; these beautiful yellow trees with the twinkly lights were all over the place!</p>
<p>(2) I joined the rest of the Instagram world and took a picture of my first red cup of the season. 🙂</p>
<p>(3) We tried out a fantastic Mexican restaurant in DC this weekend call Oyumel. The menu is full of lots of small plates to choose from &#8211; the best way I know how to describe it is Mexican tapas. The highlight of the meal was the guacamole that was mixed by our server right in front of us!</p>
<p>(4) The highlight of the weekend was going out to Barrel Oak Winery with Kaitlin and Erik for a wine tasting. After the tasting, we picked our favorite and split a bottle with some cheese and crackers. It was a great time with great friends! Look at the gorgeous fall colors behind us in the picture!</p>
