<p>I&#8217;ve been away from the Currently link-up for a while now, and so much has changed since then! I&#8217;ve decided to join in this month to break up the monotony of travel posts going up on this blog and because I miss the community that this link-up brings. My husband and I are just about to end our 2.5 month adventure around Western Europe (read about our adventures <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/tag/abernathy-adventure/" target="_blank">here</a>!), and I&#8217;m excited to get back to a good mix of regular lifestyle and travel posts. I feel like this link-up will be a great transition back into normalcy.</p>
<p><strong>Wishing</strong> | For good weather for the remaining two weeks of our trip. We have had quite the mix of snow, thunderstorms, and warm days so far on this adventure, and while we haven&#8217;t let weather affect our schedules much, we&#8217;d love to be able to explore in the sun for our last few days!</p>
<p><strong>Craving</strong> |<i> </i> Olives. ALL THE TIME. There is a funny story behind this, and I&#8217;ll make it short. Basically, I&#8217;ve spent my whole life up until about a month ago saying that I hate olives. But my husband ordered some green olives at an Italian restaurant in the UK, and my snacking life changed forever. I cannot go to the grocery store without buying olives nor can I go to a restaurant with olives on the appetizer list and not order them. I find it so funny that we have gone all these years with my husband buying olives at the store and me not eating a single one. And now I love them even more than he does!</p>
<p><b>Going </b>| To Cinque Terre, Italy for two days starting today. After that, we head on to Florence, Siena, Sorrento, Rome, and then home to Austin!</p>
<p><strong>Wearing </strong>| The same thing over and over again (jeans, a colored shirt or cardigan, and brown boots). It will be nice to get back to my closet of clothes at home! #backpackinglife</p>
<p><strong>Learning</strong> | So so much about this world. There is nothing more educational than traveling if you make the most of every place you go.</p>
