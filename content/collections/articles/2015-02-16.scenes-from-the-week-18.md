<p>Happy Monday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these quick posts, I share the highlights from my week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events.</p>
<p>This was a busy, busy week! Daniel and I both had to work long hours, but there was lots of fun and a lot of great things to celebrate this week. 🙂</p>

<p>(1) My husband&#8217;s birthday was Friday, so we celebrated by going to Salt Lick right after work. It was absolutely delicious!</p>
<p>(2) In preparation for our family party on Saturday, I picked up cupcakes from Capital City Bakery here in Austin. How cute are they? They tasted just as a great as they look. 🙂</p>
<p>(3) Saturday morning, we drove down to San Antonio to see my brother perform in the TMEA State Band. The music was beautiful! I was so proud! I&#8217;m so happy to be back in Texas so that we are able to go to events like these for and with family.</p>
<p>(4) After a fantastic enchilada lunch in San Antonio, we all drove up to Austin where everyone came to see our new apartment here and have a birthday party to celebrate my dad&#8217;s and my husband&#8217;s birthdays! My dad was excited to use his new selfie stick, so we all squeezed in for a picture.</p>

<li>Daniel and I had a wonderful Valentine&#8217;s dinner at a local restaurant.</li>
<li>We visited another church in Austin Sunday morning.</li>
<li>We spent time working at a new favorite coffee shop with my sister.</li>
<li>I finished the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-She-Does-everywomans-breaking-ebook/dp/B00JDYCY80/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424063284&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=how+she+does+it" target="_blank">How She Does It</a> by Anne Bogel, and it really made me think about what I want my work life to be like once we have kids. Great, quick read if you want to think about non-traditional ways to structure your career and schedule while being a parent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great Monday!</p>
