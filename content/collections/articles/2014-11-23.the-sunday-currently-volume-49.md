<p>Happy Sunday! I hope everyone is excited and ready for Thanksgiving week! My family is traveling from Texas up to us and renting a cabin about an hour away in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. I&#8217;m  so looking forward to again getting away from the city, enjoying quality time with the family, eating lots of yummy food, and being cozy in a cabin in the woods. 🙂</p>
<p><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></p>
<p><em>Reading </em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Paris-Wife-Random-Readers/dp/0345521315" target="_blank">The Paris Wife</a> again. I had set it down to read an eBook I had from the library that was about to expire, but I&#8217;m glad to get back to it because I love it! I&#8217;m also in the middle of listening to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Imaginary-Girls-Nova-Ren-Suma-ebook/dp/B004IYJEQU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416788455&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=imaginary+girls" target="_blank">Imaginary Girls</a> audio book for the blogger book club hosted by <a href="http://www.dreams-etc.com/" target="_blank">Crystal</a>.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>lots of plans in my planner. And notes from the<a href="http://shereadstruth.com/" target="_blank"> She Reads Truth</a> Five Hymns study. It&#8217;s a short, five day study, but it offers a lot of note-worthy content.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRIULQuh_I" target="_blank">makeup TIA&#8217;s Gift Guide for Beauty Lovers</a> video. I&#8217;m loving all of the holiday-themed videos and blog posts these days!</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>about a thousand and one things. There is a lot going on in life right now!</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> our BBW Thanksgiving Morning candle. It is delicious and just what you would imagine &#8211; the scent of cinnamon rolls, waffles, coffee, and pumpkin all blended into one!</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to keep up somewhat of a blogging rhythm during the busyness of this season. And I&#8217;m hoping for some good changes to come in this space with the new year!</p>
<p><em>Wearing  &#8211; </em>I&#8217;m home and it&#8217;s Sunday which means I&#8217;m wearing pajamas, of course!</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>all things Christmas. I can&#8217;t help it!</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>some changes to my blogging space. Not to the design (not yet at least), but to how I organize my posts and what I write about.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to remember how much I have to be thankful for this week and every week.</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>not top-notch, to be honest. I think staying in and relaxing a little tonight will help.</p>
<p><em>Clicking </em>SO MANY BLOGS. I&#8217;m so behind on my blog feed yet again. I&#8217;ve tried to clean up my subscriptions, but I&#8217;m still subscribed to way too many blogs. I&#8217;m going to have to do some serious blog feed housekeeping soon and allow myself to let go of more blogs.</p>
<p>Have a great week and happy Thanksgiving to all!</p>
