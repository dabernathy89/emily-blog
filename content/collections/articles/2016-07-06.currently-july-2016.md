<p><strong>Toasting</strong> | To my husband for finishing his third annual week-long hike on the Appalachian Trail last week! I&#8217;m so proud of him for accomplishing something like this for a third year in a row. I could never do it &#8211; it requires patience and a mindset that I could not get to. Also, I don&#8217;t think I could sleep outside and not shower for that long&#8230;. But I&#8217;m proud of him for continuing to work on his dream of hiking the whole trail!</p>
<p><strong>Going</strong> |<i> </i> To Dallas this weekend to see friends and family. We have many friends and family members in that area, so we are long overdue for a visit! Also, we are headed to Louisville for a quick weekend trip at the end of the month! Does anyone have any recommendations? We&#8217;ve never been before.</p>
<p><b>Smelling </b>| My Fiji White Sands Bath &amp; Body Works candle. It smells divine &#8211; creamy coconut, lime, and fresh beach air. Summer at its finest!</p>
<p><strong>Wearing </strong>| A t-shirt and cotton shorts. Trying to stay comfortable and cool in this Texas heat&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Wishlisting</strong> | Decor for the apartment. I&#8217;m finally getting moving on some decorating projects I&#8217;ve put off for a while, but I&#8217;m waiting for a sale at Michael&#8217;s or Hobby Lobby on custom mats for some prints I want to hang up. Getting mats custom-made is expensive! Unfortunately, it&#8217;s necessary for these prints since they are not a customary size. Can&#8217;t wait to get this project finished!</p>
<p><strong>Reading</strong> | <u>I Let You Go</u> by Clare Mackintosh. I&#8217;m just getting into it, but so far it&#8217;s a pretty interesting mystery.</p>
<p><strong>Watching</strong> | The Good Wife. I&#8217;m on season 3, and it just gets better and better. I&#8217;m also still watching The Bachelorette, of course. Actually, my sister and I are going to a concert for two of the contestants this week! We even have meet and greet passes. For those of you who watch, we will be meeting James Taylor and Luke Pell, the two Texas boys! I have no idea what I will say to them when we meet them, but it should be fun!</p>
<p><strong>Listening</strong> | To <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Rumor</span> by Elin Hilderbrand on Audible, still. I&#8217;m in a music rut though, so any music recommendations would be great! I&#8217;ve been listening to old favorites on repeat, but I&#8217;m ready for something new.</p>
