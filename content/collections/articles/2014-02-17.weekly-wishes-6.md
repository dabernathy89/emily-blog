<p>Each Monday night, I link up with <a href="http://thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to share my &#8220;wishes&#8221; or goals for the week and to see how I did on my goals last week. I missed last week do to a crazy work schedule, so I&#8217;m going to start with a clean slate and just make some new goals for this week.</p>
<h1>This Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Order my prints for my January Project Life layout and, if time allows,  put it together.</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Finish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Is-Where-Leave-You/dp/0452296366" target="_blank">This is Where I Leave You</a>. </strong>Not loving it so far, but I&#8217;m going to keep going with it.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Make it to  BodyPump Thursday evening, yoga on Saturday, and BodyPump again on Sunday. Do a short, at-home workout on Tuesday.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m keeping things simple this week. Looking forward to having a little more time than earlier this month to work on personal goals.</p>
