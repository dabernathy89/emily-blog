<p>I have a dilemma. I can never seem to get good pictures for this post. I was out all morning: I went to the gym and then to brunch with friends, and I completely forgot to take a picture of any of that. Now I&#8217;m in my usual spot for a Sunday afternoon (a coffee shop), and I&#8217;m sharing with you the same picture I always seem to do&#8230; one of my computer, coffee, and books/notebooks. One day I&#8217;ll get better at the picture-taking aspect of  blogging, I hope&#8230;.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading</em>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Thief-Markus-Zusak/dp/0375842209" target="_blank">The Book Thief</a>. I&#8217;m starting this today actually. Some friends from work have put together a book club! Our first time to meet is in two weeks, so I want to get started. I&#8217;ve read it before, but it was a long time ago, so I need to refresh my memory by reading it again. I&#8217;m also reading excerpts here and there from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daily-Rituals-How-Artists-Work/dp/0307273601/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389559391&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=daily+rituals" target="_blank">Daily Rituals: How Artists Work</a> &#8211; if you like routine and enjoy reading about other people&#8217;s routines, you probably want to take a look at this book. But if you read this thinking how could anyone ever be interested in this (most of you probably), then you probably want to avoid it. 🙂</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>another blog post. It&#8217;s much harder to keep up with good content on a blog than I realized.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to the music on my iPad on shuffle. I&#8217;m finally starting to get into non-Christmas music, but I still need a little help. Any great album recommendations?</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>about how much I love Sundays. It seems the world slows down and people take the time to do the things they love on this day. At least, it seems that way when I&#8217;m surrounded by people reading and writing and visiting with friends in a coffee shop.</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em> coffee and books. We are at our favorite place to work &#8211; Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> that Sundays didn&#8217;t fly by so quickly</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to still be able to eat dinners at home this week. Things are starting to get really busy at work already.</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>a long-sleeved t-shirt and jeans. I did not bring a coat out with me today, and I regret that decision. Just because we have had several below 10 degree days doesn&#8217;t mean that 40 degrees is warm.</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> that I got to have brunch with friends today! We had fun catching up.</p>
<p><em>Wanting </em> to stop by the Container Store after this. I have several areas in my apartment that I really want to organize&#8230;. But that store is dangerous!</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to keep up with working out! Unfortunately, that means going to the gym at 6am tomorrow.</p>
