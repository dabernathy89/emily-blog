<p>Happy Friday!  I have started this series so that I can share the more memorable events in my week as well as the small things throughout the week that made me smile. Here is a glimpse into scenes from my week:</p>
<h1>Monday</h1>
<p>Monday was pretty uneventful. In the evening, Daniel and I had BBQ chicken sandwiches for dinner and walked over to Sweet Frog to get froyo. I always get Cake Batter and Dulce de Leche with graham cracker pieces mixed in.</p>

<h1>Tuesday</h1>
<p>I woke up bright and early Tuesday to catch a 7am flight to Atlanta for a client meeting. My team spent most of the morning and early afternoon in the office, but we did get away for lunch. We went to Houston&#8217;s, and I ordered the most delicious salad &#8211; it was a chopped salad with avocados, blue cheese, chicken, buttermilk garlic dressing, tomatoes, croutons, and more. So good! After our afternoon meeting, we hurried back to the airport to catch our 3:15pm flight back home to DC. Quick trip!</p>
<p>Tuesday was my sister Ellen&#8217;s birthday, so I talked to her for a little bit once I got home. I can&#8217;t believe she is 21!</p>
<h1>Wednesday</h1>
<p>Wednesday after work we had leftovers for dinner, and I had a very productive evening getting a blog post together and doing some cleaning. I also discovered one of my new favorite blogs &#8211; <a href="http://www.gutenblogyall.com/" target="_blank">Guten Blog Y&#8217;all</a>!</p>
<h1>Thursday</h1>
<p>At work I discovered the Begin Again soundtrack was on Spotify. I played it over and over again, so even though it was a pretty stressful day at work, I felt happy the whole day.</p>
<p>For lunch my co-worker and I went to meet our friend Lauren for lunch at Sweetwater Tavern. It was really fun to catch up and take a break away from the computer.</p>
<p>Daniel and I ate dinner while watching Pretty Little Liars (yes, we love this show), and I took more funny pictures of Banana (I can&#8217;t stop!). I then cleaned and packed to get ready for our trip to Wake Forest, North Carolina this weekend to visit my cousin and his wife.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;ve decided that my Scenes From the Week posts will cover just Monday through Thursday. I typically give a recap of my weekend in my <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/the-sunday-currently/" target="_blank">The Sunday Currently </a>posts. Have a great weekend!</p>
