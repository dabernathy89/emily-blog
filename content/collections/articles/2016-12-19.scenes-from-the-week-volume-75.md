<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Thursday we had a little Christmas date. We went out to dinner and then went to a fancy neighborhood to look at fancy Christmas lights. We found a good area that I think we will continue to go to for Christmas light viewing in future years!</p>
<p>(2) Of course we ordered a cheese board for dinner on Thursday at Vox Table, a favorite local date night spot.</p>
<p>(3) Saturday was Christmas with extended family on my dad&#8217;s side at my grandparents&#8217; in east Texas. My grandma (&#8220;Mama Dee&#8221;) loves Christmas more than anyone I know, and she had a great time having all her kids, grandkids, and great-grandkids over to celebrate and exchange a LOT of presents. We played some games, ate good food, and just enjoyed each other&#8217;s company.</p>
<p>(4) Saturday night we did our family Christmas exchange at my parents&#8217; house in Waco. Their tree and all the home decorations are beautiful!</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tons of Christmas shopping and present wrapping</li>
<li>Preparations for a holiday Bahamas cruise with Daniel&#8217;s family</li>
<li>A great women&#8217;s networking happy hour event with my work</li>
<li>A Sunday flight to Miami with some luggage drama (but I&#8217;m happy to report that all bags and people have made it on the cruise ship)</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Blog:</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t post anything else last week, and you likely won&#8217;t be hearing from me again until next week&#8217;s Scenes From the Week post since we will be at sea on a cruise having family time. I have big plans for more consistent posting in the new year!</p>
<p>I wish you and your family a very Merry Christmas! Have a great week!</p>
