<p>I&#8217;m writing this from St. Petersburg, FL! We are here visiting Daniel&#8217;s Grandma for the weekend, and we head back home tomorrow night. We both have to work remotely from here tomorrow, but staying the extra day allowed us to have two full days to spend with his Grandma and his aunt who also lives here. Saturday we enjoyed a late breakfast, and then Daniel and I took the dogs for a walk around the lovely neighborhood. This part of Florida is just gorgeous!</p>

<p>Afterwards, all of us went over to Daniel&#8217;s Aunt June&#8217;s house to visit, and then we grabbed some delicious Cuban sandwiches for lunch. That evening Daniel and I ran off to the beach for a little bit before a storm came in, and we got home in time for dinner and a game of Carcassonne with June and his Grandma.</p>

<p>Today has been such a treat. We went to a service at the church that Daniel&#8217;s parents were married, and then we went to the FreeFall Theatre Company to see the play One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#8217;s Nest. The play was incredible! At this theater, the audience is integrated into the set of the play, so the actors are literally running around people in the audience. The acting, the set, the lighting, the sounds effects, and the immersive experience were all very, very impressive.</p>
<p>We ended the evening by going out for pasta with June and seeing Guardians of the Galaxy. Now I&#8217;m really ready to go to sleep!</p>

<h2><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Light-Between-Oceans-Novel/dp/1451681755" target="_blank">The Light Between Oceans</a>. As you can see, we have had a busy weekend, so I have not been reading a lot still. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading a lot on the plane tomorrow.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>just this post really. I haven&#8217;t been doing any extra writing lately due to all of our travel.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to the clacking of my keyboard and the whirring of the fan above</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I&#8217;m really not ready to start working longer hours for busy season at work. At least this busy season is much shorter than the Spring busy season!</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> a whiff of my refreshing Tea Tree Water facial spray. Yes, I&#8217;m still using this product &#8211; it is probably my favorite LUSH product that I&#8217;ve tried.</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>for a productive week both at the office and with various things I have going on (or want to be going on) at home</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>my pajamas. I&#8217;m going to fall right to sleep as soon as I publish this post.</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>that we have had such an amazing summer of travel and seeing friends and family. I&#8217;m also loving that several &#8220;no-plans&#8221; weekends are ahead for us starting next weekend.</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to get up and grab a nice big glass of cold water. I have been really good about drinking lots of water throughout the day lately! I&#8217;d like to keep it up.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to read more books. I&#8217;m likely not going to be able to finish the <a title="Semi-Charmed Summer 2014 Book Challenge" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/05/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge/" target="_blank">summer reading challenge</a> that I&#8217;m doing, and that&#8217;s okay, but I&#8217;ve got a long list of other books I&#8217;d like to read before the end of the year.</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>sleepy, again.</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>Bloglovin&#8217;, but I have a lot of catching up to do on my blog feed.</p>
