<p>Each week, I link up with <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/2014/07/weekly-wishes-60/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to join the community of bloggers who share their goals for the week. I&#8217;m continuing to update my goals for the entire month of July rather than having a new set of goals each week. Right now, thinking about my to-dos in this big picture format has been working the best for me.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder why I post these goals updates, but then I remember how much I am motivated by reading other people&#8217;s goals, and I also think about the encouragement I have gotten from doing this link-up. For these reasons, I definitely want to continue doing these posts, at least for the time being. I don&#8217;t expect that most people would like reading goals updates, but that&#8217;s okay!</p>
<h2>July Goals</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Read three books. </strong>I should be wrapping up book #2 soon! It has been great to be back into a good habit of reading.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Organize my jewelry. </strong>Over the weekend, I was randomly walking past The Container Store, so I dropped in to take another look at the jewelry organization sets I have been eyeing for months. Well, they happened to be on sale, so I took that as a sign that I should buy them. I had some good ideas on cheaper alternatives, but none of them were working for me due to my small drawer space and various other reasons. I&#8217;m happy with the purchase, and I look forward to diving in and being reunited with all the jewelry I have forgotten about over the years.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Revamp my blog design and layout!! </strong>I am happy to report that I have a fun, new blog design and layout nearly ready to go! Daniel helped me out over the weekend &#8211; I could not have done this without him. We had hoped to launch it Sunday night, but there are a few more things I want to tweak before I completely transition over. I imagine it will be up by one week from now, and I can&#8217;t wait!</p>
<p>4. <strong>Write all of my posts about our Europe trip that I have planned&#8230; and post them! </strong>I am not making good progress on this goal. I may have to give myself some extra time to actually write all of the remaining posts, but I plan to have the next one up soon (hopefully this week).</p>
<p>5. <strong>Explore <a href="http://www.skillshare.com" target="_blank">SkillShare</a> classes and start working on one. </strong>From last week: &#8220;I want to be a life-long learner. To me this involves reading fiction and non-fiction, traveling, working on a language with my Duolingo app, watching documentaries, working on playing an instrument (for me, this would be piano, but I haven&#8217;t played in years), keeping up with current events, and taking classes just for the sake of learning. I&#8217;ve done a decent job of being a life-long learner in some of these areas, but I want to work on the areas I&#8217;m neglecting. Hopefully, signing up for SkillShare will help me to grow and work my brain! Do you have any class recommendations? I&#8217;m interested in so many different things, but I imagine I would want my first class to be related to developing my blog since that is currently my main hobby.&#8221; I have looked into and started a couple of classes, but I haven&#8217;t committed to one just yet!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy with my goal progress as of this week. Hopefully, I can keep it up! In other news, I think I am getting sick, so I&#8217;m going to bed as soon as I publish this. Goodnight, world!</p>
