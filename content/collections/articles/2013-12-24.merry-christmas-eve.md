<p>It&#8217;s Christmas Eve! I&#8217;ve decided this is my favorite day of the year. We have had such a great time visiting family, exchanging gifts, and eating great food. Today we are going to lunch at my grandparents, and then we are going to see a movie everyone in the family should enjoy (including my grandparents), <a href="http://movies.disney.com/saving-mr-banks" target="_blank">Saving Mr. Banks</a>. After the movie, we will go to a Christmas Eve service at the church Daniel and I used to go to when we went to school here in Waco, and then we will do my immediate family&#8217;s Christmas Eve tradition of reading the Christmas story and exchanging gifts this evening.</p>
<p>I wish you a day full of fun, food, and celebration with your family and friends. And with that, I&#8217;ll leave you with this video to make you smile:</p>
