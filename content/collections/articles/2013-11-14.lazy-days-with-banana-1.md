<p>We have an orange cat named Banana. He is a furry little ball of joy that I look forward to going home to everyday (along with my husband, of course!). We adopted him a little over a year ago, and he came to us with the name Banana. At first, we were hesitant and wanted to change his name, but then it grew on us. Now I absolutely love how his name makes people chuckle, and it just seems to suit him in an unexplainable way.</p>
<p>Daniel and I take pictures of Banana all the time. He never ceases to crack us up with his funny poses and adorable faces. He acts much like a dog &#8211; begging for cuddles and people food, waiting at the door for us to come home from work, and always striving to be the center of attention.  He is also quite fat and loves to eat plastic and lick windows. He is a strange one. But we love him!</p>
<p>I decided that I&#8217;d like to share a glimpse into the life of Banana with a monthly series called &#8220;Lazy Days with Banana&#8221;. While these posts won&#8217;t entertain everyone (feel free to click away), I think that these photos may provide amusement for some. Welcome to Banana&#8217;s little world!</p>
