<p>Twice a month I link up with <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to join the community of bloggers who share their goals for the week in the Weekly Wishes link-up. I&#8217;m continuing to update my goals for the entire month twice a month rather than having a new set of goals each week. Right now, thinking about my to-dos in this big picture format has been working the best for me.</p>
<p>First I&#8217;ll recap my August goals and report my progress on them. Then I&#8217;ll share my list of September goals.</p>
<h2>August Goals</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Get as far as  I can in the <a title="Semi-Charmed Summer 2014 Book Challenge" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/05/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge/" target="_blank">summer reading challenge</a> I&#8217;m participating in.</strong> Well, the reading challenge is now over. I did not do much reading this month unfortunately, but I had such a great time participating in the challenge and getting as far as I did. See the bottom of this post for the progress that I made overall on the reading challenge.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Organize our linen closet. </strong>Done! I&#8217;m so happy to have a more organized space in our bathroom closet. I went through all of my make-up and nail polish and other products; I found lots of fun products that I forgot I had as well as many things that were definitely needing to be thrown out. I was able to use organizational tools that I already had, so no purchases were necessary for this project. This was a definite success!</p>
<p>3.<strong> Write and post all of my Paris <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/travel-with-me/" target="_blank">Travel With Me</a> posts.</strong> Nope. I wrote and published one, and I&#8217;ve mostly written my second one. That means I&#8217;ll publish the second either this week or next and then try to follow up with the third shortly after that.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Start and complete a SkillShare class (or two). </strong>I&#8217;m almost done with the blog content planning class &#8211; I&#8217;ll finish it this week.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Starting today, post a daily photo on Instagram.</strong> I didn&#8217;t post an Instagram photo every single day, but I did most days! It was a lot of fun. I&#8217;m going to keep trying to post Instagram photos regularly.</p>
<h2>September Goals</h2>
<p>Oh, September, how I both loathe and love you! The first half of September is always overwhelmingly busy with work due to the 9/15 tax deadline, but the second half brings a slower time at work and Fall, my very favorite season. So, I&#8217;m writing these goals knowing that I probably won&#8217;t be making much progress on them until the second half of September.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Make an <a href="http://www.artifactuprising.com/site/home" target="_blank">Artifact Uprising</a> book for our London/Paris trip from earlier this year. </strong>Originally, I was planning to make separate Project Life albums for our travels, but I think that keeping one Project Life album per year for our daily life is enough. I have seen a few friends&#8217; and bloggers&#8217; photo books created with Artifact Uprising, and they are gorgeous! They are a decent price as well. I&#8217;m looking forward to starting this travel book tradition!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Organize the cabinet under our kitchen sink. </strong>Continuing on with my one organizational project per month, I&#8217;m giving myself a bit of an easier task this month. While this space under our sink is really out of hand, it is small, so it should only take a couple of hours in one afternoon to get into good shape.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Make good progress on another SkillShare class. </strong>I&#8217;m going to try to get myself into somewhat of a routine in taking these classes. I think I&#8217;ll start with the goal of two hours per week to see if that is manageable.</p>
<p>4.<strong> Read two books. </strong>I have a fun <a title="Reading List // 02" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/08/reading-list-02/" target="_blank">reading list</a> for myself, and I&#8217;m excited to make some progress. We have a short beach vacation at the end of the month, and I can&#8217;t wait to do some reading in a beach setting.</p>
<p>5.<strong> Decorate for Fall.</strong> Again Fall is my favorite season. It is one of two seasons that I actually buy seasonal decorations for (the other is Christmas, of course). I can&#8217;t wait to pull out our old Fall decorations and pick up a few new ones.</p>
