<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Month series! Formerly called <a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/scenes-from-the-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scenes From the Week</a>, I have started sharing these monthly instead. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous month ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have a little boy, everyday moments are extra special!</p>

<p>(1) On Labor Day weekend, my parents took Carson to their home in San Antonio for a grandkid weekend! Daniel took off to Denver with his friend, so it was just me at home for the weekend. I slept and slept and read and got things done around the house and&#8230;.</p>
<p>(2) Visited a favorite coffee shop and breakfast taco place solo (so nice!) and&#8230;.</p>
<p>(3) Drove to San Antonio for the day on Saturday to join my parents and Carson for a zoo day! Carson got to feed the giraffe lettuce and loved it! Such a sweet moment.</p>
<p>(4) It was blazing hot outside (because Texas&#8230;), but we still tried to enjoy the fall decorations that the zoo had for Boo at the Zoo!</p>

<p>(1) Uncle Jacob (Daniel&#8217;s twin brother) came for a visit! Carson wasn&#8217;t feeling great during Jacob&#8217;s whole visit, but he still managed to get in some giggles!</p>
<p>(2) We decorated the front porch for fall! I have been so excited for our first fall and Christmas in our new (and first) home together. Carson tried to help me out with the hay bales and pumpkins.</p>
<p>(3) Our lizard friend brought a pal to our back patio. This was the last time I saw them. The cold weather kicked in part-way through the month, so they have now left for another warmer home.</p>
<p>(4) We continued getting in as many neighborhood walks as we could! Carson loves to walk and explore.</p>

<p>(1) We just had to go to a pumpkin patch! We picked one that a nearby restaurant had in their backyard. We got some cute photos, saw some friends, and enjoyed watching Carson bounce around in his first bounce house.</p>
<p>(2) Best family photo we could get with our wiggly 18-month-old!</p>
<p>(3) Carson loves to pick out a book from his shelves throughout the day. This is him picking his post-bath bedtime read.</p>
<p>(4) More family walks in the nice fall weather</p>

<p>(1) The biggest event of the month was our family vacation to London! It was wonderful. Carson did so well for his first international trip.  I have so many photos to share from that trip, but I&#8217;ll share those in a dedicated London post! This photo was taken while we explored the Greenwich area of London.</p>
<p>(2) This photo was the morning of Carson&#8217;s second Halloween! I couldn&#8217;t get him to pose for a photo, but he was wearing his cute Mickey Halloween shirt to daycare that day.</p>
<p>(3) And that evening, we took Carson trick-or-treating for the first time. He dressed up as a baby dinosaur!! He enjoyed riding around the neighborhood in his wagon, going up to houses to say hi and put candy from his bucket into their candy bowls (haha!), and&#8230;.</p>
<p>(4) &#8230;trying out some white chocolate Reese&#8217;s for the first time!</p>
<h2>Favorites from the Month:</h2>
<p>Book &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/2K0utfh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Witch Elm</em></a> by Tana French. If you enjoy thrillers, mysteries, etc, you must read some of Tana French&#8217;s books! This is her only book outside of her Dublin Murder Squad series (at least that I&#8217;m aware of).  I listened to it primarily on audiobook. It is long and a bit too detailed (IMO) in some parts, but overall I loved the story, the mystery, and the setting. All of her books take place in Ireland and make for cozy, fall mystery reads.</p>
<p>Music &#8211; We listened to a lot of Harry Potter soundtrack music in October!</p>
<p>Activity &#8211; Roadtripping around the Cotswolds on our vacation in England</p>
<p>Accomplishment &#8211; Getting our one-year-old to England and back in one piece, and being able to have a good time while doing it!</p>
<p>I hope everyone has a lovely November!
