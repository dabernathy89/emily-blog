<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

We saw lots of friends and family, but I somehow managed to not take any photos of people! Bummer. But I&#8217;m excited to share the week with you!</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Daniel&#8217;s twin brother Jacob came to visit us over the weekend, so we tried to take him around town and eat at a few delicious restaurants. Saturday night we took a walk down to the pedestrian bridge, and then we ended up walking all the way to the new downtown library location! See #2 and 3 below.</p>
<p>(2) The new Central Public Library in downtown Austin is fabulous.  It was a $125 million project that was approved over seven years ago. It has mostly been well-received by Austinites. It is a truly gorgeous space with plenty of outlet-equipped window seats to work on your laptop with a city or river view, a rooftop garden to sit and enjoy a book with a view (view from the downtown-facing side shown here), and a wonderful children&#8217;s section that I can&#8217;t wait to take Baby Boy to in the future! The design of the interior and exterior spaces is tasteful and impressive too.</p>
<p>(3) This is the view from the rooftop garden into the library down the various floors. The view from the bottom floor up is very cool &#8211; the series of staircases look straight out of Harry Potter. It&#8217;s gorgeous!</p>
<p>(4) Sunday morning we tried out brunch at Frank downtown. This pictures is our &#8220;donetzel&#8221; board which had a selection of seasonal pretzel donuts. The rest of the meal was wonderful too!</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>

<li>Going to our anatomy scan for Baby Boy. The technician looked at all of baby&#8217;s vital organs and confirmed he&#8217;s a boy! At 17 weeks, he is quite the wiggle worm, and he could not sit still during his scan. We loved learning the details about his development and are thrilled that everything is developing as expected!</li>
<li>Dinner with our friends Sara and Thom at Boiler Nine. We hadn&#8217;t seen them since January, so it was great to catch up on life and hear about their recent trip to China.</li>
<li>Dinner with our friends Kaelin and Andres at a new place in Austin, Krua Urban Thai. This place was awesome! The food and service were fantastic, and it felt like a nice restaurant without the price tag of one. I highly recommend it!</li>
<li>Going to my sister&#8217;s boyfriend Jason&#8217;s birthday party Friday night. The theme was Goodwill, so we all wore tacky Goodwill outfits, some more tacky than others! 🙂</li>
<li>Eating a homemade breakfast of pumpkin waffles and eggs Saturday morning with Daniel and Jacob (and Banana begging at our feet)</li>
<li>Introducing Jacob to the wonderful world of ramen at Ramen Tatsu-ya 🙂</li>
<li>Planning details for our upcoming Christmas party! Thank you Pinterest&#8230;.</li>
<li>Enjoying a wonderful Thanksgiving meal with our small group on Sunday night</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
