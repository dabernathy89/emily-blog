<p>This weekend has been all about getting ready for our trip this Wednesday!! I&#8217;ve been pre-writing blog posts, running tons of errands, making reservations at restaurants in Paris, spending time with friends, etc. It&#8217;s been fun, and I am just so, so excited.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Film-Novel-Marisha-Pessl/dp/140006788X" target="_blank">Night Film</a>. I was not very good about reading this week (which is sad considering I posted about doing a <a title="Semi-Charmed Summer 2014 Book Challenge" href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/05/01/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge/" target="_blank">book challenge</a> last week). But I&#8217;m still loving it and am planning on wrapping it up on the plane next week.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>so many blog posts!</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to a mix of stations on Pandora and my laundry going</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>about London and Paris&#8230;. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to be quite repetitive in this post.</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  the Bath and Body Works Cinnamon Sugared Donut candle. Normally, I save the dessert and baking scented candles for the fall and winter, but I could not turn this one down while browsing around BBW. It is delightful, and I feel like I&#8217;m eating a donut when I smell this candle.</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> time would slow down today just a little bit. So much to do in so little time!</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>that things go smoothly at work Monday and Tuesday, so that I can leave the office for a week and a half feeling like I&#8217;ve left projects in a good place.</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>my pjs. I need to run and change here very soon because we are having brunch with friends!</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> oh, you know, all things London and Paris 🙂</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>brunch! We are going to a great place nearby, and I can&#8217;t wait to try out something new along with my standard cup of coffee.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to do lots and lots and lots of things. My to-do list is massive, y&#8217;all.<br />
<del></del></p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  &#8230; Can I say it again without being annoying? So excited for our trip!!!</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>blog posts, but I should stop and get ready for the day!<a href="https://twitter.com/siddathornton"><br />

<p>Have a beautiful Sunday!</p>
