<p>We had such a great time with our family and friends in Texas over the holidays! We were blessed to be able to spend two weeks there&#8211;which is about the minimum amount of time we need to see each of our immediate families, extended family, and just a handful of our friends. We typically make it home only twice a year, so it is always special when we do.</p>
<p>Even though I didn&#8217;t take as many pictures during our trip as I had hoped to, I think I can give you a good glimpse of most of the highlights. Again, please excuse the bad quality of the iPhone pictures&#8230;. I&#8217;m hoping that once I upgrade to the iPhone 5 in April I&#8217;ll have much better quality photos!</p>

<p>Part of the reason we are able the travel away for so long is that both of us have the ability to work remotely occasionally. I had to work the first few days I was in Waco with my family, but it was okay because I had my favorite chubby snowman mug filled with a warm drink most of the day!</p>

<p>During the first weekend, we went to a Baylor basketball game with several of our family members.</p>

<p>We won!</p>

<p>The day before Christmas Eve, we traveled to a small town in East Texas to celebrate Christmas with my dad&#8217;s side of the family. We had so much fun! We even pulled out some old toys from when me, my sisters, and cousins were little&#8230;..</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" style="line-height:1.5em;" alt="20140108-225532.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225532.jpg" /></p>
<p>We were also given fun toe socks to put on when we arrived!</p>

<p>My grandparents know how to keep all the family members happy!</p>

<p>Opening stocking goodies!</p>
<p><a style="line-height:1.5em;" href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225814.jpg"><img alt="20140108-225814.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225814.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>My sisters are definitely too cool&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225821.jpg"><img alt="20140108-225821.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225821.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>My grandma collects nativity scenes. This one was just too cute not to share!</p>
<p><a href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225853.jpg"><img alt="20140108-225853.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225853.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>All of the stockings for all of the family members</p>
<p><a href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-232037.jpg"><img alt="20140108-232037.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-232037.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Christmas Day in Waco was not very cold. That was somewhat of a bummer for me since I always hope for that white Christmas, but we made the best of it and went hiking in Cameron Park with the family.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" alt="20140108-225600.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225600.jpg" /></p>
<p>A couple of days after Christmas, my mom&#8217;s side of the family had a scavenger hunt around Waco that my uncle put together. It was a blast! Daniel and I were on opposing teams, but we were able to forget our rivalry to take a few pictures. 🙂 I won&#8217;t go into the details on the scavenger hunt here, but I will say that one activity required the whole team to sing the National Anthem barefoot in front of a Cracker Barrel while having a stranger film us&#8230;.</p>

<p>A few days later, we had lunch at McAlister&#8217;s with Daniel&#8217;s parents. I definitely missed this sweet tea!</p>
<p><a href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225637.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" alt="20140108-225637.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225637.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>One evening we were able to slip away for dinner and dessert with our friend Shannon and her new fiance Jonathan!</p>
<p><a href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225646.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" alt="20140108-225646.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225646.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>It was so good to see them!</p>
<p><a href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225903.jpg"><img alt="20140108-225903.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225903.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The next day we made our way back to Downtown Fort Worth to say goodbye to our favorite Barnes &amp; Noble ever on the last day it was open. This Barnes &amp; Noble houses so many high school and college memories because we went here on date nights and with friends a countless number of times. Now it is closed, but we were happy to get to see it one more time!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most of our time with Daniel&#8217;s family was filled with sick days. We still made time for fun though! This is us bowling with the family. I&#8217;m terrible at bowling, but it&#8217;s so much fun!</p>
<p><a href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225912.jpg"><img alt="20140108-225912.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225912.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Daniel went with some college friends to the Baylor Fiesta Bowl game in Arizona, so I was able to spend New Year&#8217;s Eve in Dallas with Becca, one of my best friends!</p>
<p><a href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225712.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" alt="20140108-225712.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225712.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>On New Year&#8217;s Day, I drove back down to Waco to watch the bowl game with my family. Let&#8217;s not talk about the results of that game&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225720.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" alt="20140108-225720.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225720.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The next day I said goodbye to my family and headed back to Aledo to hang out with Daniel&#8217;s family.</p>
<p><a href="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225729.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" alt="20140108-225729.jpg" src="https://images.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/01/20140108-225729.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>On our last night in Texas, we went to Fort Worth for Daniel&#8217;s favorite BBQ of all time: Cooper&#8217;s. He was very, very happy!</p>
