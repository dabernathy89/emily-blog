<p>Happy Friday! I have started this Scenes From the Week series  so that I can share both the more memorable events in my week as well as the small things that made me smile. Here is a glimpse into my first week in August:</p>
<h1>Monday</h1>
<p>Daniel and I were still in St. Petersburg, Florida on Monday. We both worked remotely for most of the day, but we were able to take a lunch break to go to The Crab Shack with Daniel&#8217;s grandma and Aunt June. One last delicious vacation meal before going home to reality and trying to be healthy&#8230;.</p>

<p>That evening we took a direct flight from Tampa to D.C. It was a quick weekend trip, but it was such a nice time.</p>
<h1>Tuesday</h1>
<p>Daniel and I have both been working later now since we both are in somewhat of a busy season at work.</p>
<p>After work Tuesday, I met Daniel at the grocery store, and we picked up a lot of food and household items! Before that, it had been quite some time since we did a serious grocery trip due to all of our weekend travel. By the time we got home, it was around 8:30pm, so we just decided to order pizza and save our groceries for the coming days. There goes that goal to be healthy this week&#8230;.</p>
<h1>Wednesday</h1>
<p>I left work with a huge headache and a bad mood. When I got home, Daniel had cleaned the bathroom and had started making chicken and veggie kabobs for dinner! #besthubbyaward</p>

<p>The rest of the evening, I wrote some blog posts and stayed up way too late reading a book.</p>
<h1>Thursday</h1>
<p>After a dinner of spaghetti and roasted asparagus, I baked a lemon cake for Friday&#8217;s dinner with our friends and caught up on my blog feed. The center of the cake fell out as I dumped it from the bundt cake pan onto a plate, so we were able to have a little taste-testing party&#8230;.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! Once we got home from Florida, it was a pretty simple week. And I&#8217;m looking forward to more of the same this weekend!</p>
<p>What did you do this week?</p>
