<p><span id=":179" dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;">Happy Friday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts I share the highlights from my week &#8211; from memorable events to the small things that made me smile.</span></p>
<p>It has been a nice, easy-going week so far. It has been wonderful to be home or with friends for dinner each night, and I&#8217;ve picked back up with reading books, keeping up with my blog feed, organizing around the apartment, and spending time with my husband!</p>
<p>Here is a glimpse into my week:</p>
<h1>Monday</h1>
<p>After taking lots of time off last week, it was back to work on Monday. I purchased a couple of songs from the new Maroon 5 album and was able to get a lot done. I caught up on bills and such over lunch.</p>
<p>After work, a few packages came in with fun stuff that I had ordered last week including Bath &amp; Body Works goodies and new work shoes from DSW.</p>
<h1>Tuesday</h1>
<p>Tuesday was business as usual at work. I joined some friends outside for lunch. Even though it was a brisk 63 degrees that afternoon, it was nice and warm in the sun. It felt good to be outside getting some fresh air.</p>
<h1>Wednesday</h1>
<p>I worked from home on Wednesday. I tried out the Trader Joe&#8217;s Pumpkin salad kit (pictured below), but sadly, I did not like it at all. Even though I love all pumpkin sweets, I just can&#8217;t get into savory pumpkin dishes.</p>

<p>When I walked over to Starbucks during the afternoon, I remember thinking that it was the first time the weather really felt like Fall. It was gorgeous! Some of the trees in our neighborhood are even starting to change colors. Once I pushed through some more work, Daniel came home, and then we had breakfast for dinner (pumpkin spice pancakes and eggs!). After that we watched several more episodes of The Killing. We are making our way through Season 2 way too quickly, but it&#8217;s just so addicting!</p>
<p>I wrapped up my post on our fall decor, packed for our weekend trip, and then went to bed. We stayed up way too late.</p>

<h1>Thursday</h1>
<p>Daniel and I both worked full days and then ran home to throw our things into the car and take off! We drove the full five hours to the Outer Banks that evening, and we only stopped once for gas, once for dinner at Chick-fil-A, and once for milkshakes at Sonic (it was a delicious road trip). Once we made it to our rental in Nags Head, we got settled in and went to bed.</p>
<p>How was your week?</p>
