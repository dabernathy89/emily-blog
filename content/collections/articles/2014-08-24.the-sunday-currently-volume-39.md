<p>Happy Sunday! I&#8217;m going to continue posting the TSC posts even though the link-up has sadly ended. I really enjoy using these posts as a weekend re-cap and to share what I am doing on my most relaxed day of the week. I did a terrible job taking pictures this weekend, so there aren&#8217;t many. I will have to do a better job next weekend!</p>
<p>I was craving tex-mex Friday night, so we went over to Old Town Alexandria to Austin Grill. We really love that place. It is great for a simple, indulgent meal of chips &amp; queso along with enchiladas, rice, and beans.</p>

<p>Saturday morning Daniel and I met up at Starbucks with my friend Catherine to discuss blogging and social media over coffee. We had a great time chatting, and she even showed us her beautiful photo book of her trip to various places in France and Spain! It definitely brought out the travel bug in me again&#8230;.</p>
<p>After that, I headed to a yoga class at the gym, and when I got home, I worked for the rest of the day. Thankfully, we had a fun party to look forward to that evening: Kaitlin &amp; Erik hosted a summer cocktail get-together! We brought some delicious Bourbon Meatballs that I found on Pinterest, so those were cooking in the crock pot as I worked. We had a great time that evening hanging out with both old and new friends.</p>
<p>Today after church was a time for me to get things done around the apartment. Unfortunately, Daniel had to go to the office to work for a bit, but on a positive note, I can get more done while he isn&#8217;t here!</p>
<p>We ended the day with a few errands and a dinner outside at Nando&#8217;s. It was a gorgeous evening for an outdoor meal!</p>

<p><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></p>
<p><em>Reading  </em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paper-Towns-John-Green/dp/014241493X" target="_blank">Paper Towns</a> still. I am getting more into it though! I may even finish it today. I have such a long <a title="Reading List // 02" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/08/reading-list-02/" target="_blank">reading list</a>, so I want to get moving on it!</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>cards to some friends (I love hand-written letters!) and a post about all the delicious food that we ate in Paris (see what we did in Paris <a title="Travel With Me // Paris – What We Did" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/08/travel-with-me-paris-what-we-did/" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to the OneRepublic Pandora station. I don&#8217;t love all of the current popular Top 40 music, but this station does the perfect job of playing the popular songs that I do love!</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that it&#8217;s time for another trip to Bath &amp; Body Works! I can&#8217;t even handle the Fall goodness <a href="http://www.bathandbodyworks.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=4147333&amp;cm_sp=FO-_-Home+%26+Candles-_-3-Wick+Candles&amp;cp=12586994.12936192" target="_blank">here</a>&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> the remnants of my final summer candle &#8211; a yummy citrus scent</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to get up off the couch and cross more thing off of my to-do list after I publish this post</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>my pajamas. It&#8217;s just a pajama kind of day, as many Sunday afternoons and evenings are.</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>the mac &amp; cheese that I ate for lunch. YUM!</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>another warm mug of coffee</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to make some phone calls this week. I have been out of touch with family and friends, and I want to change that!</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>rested and relaxed. That does not mean I&#8217;m ready for Monday though&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>Pinterest! I haven&#8217;t done much on Pinterest over the years, but I think that may be about to change. I&#8217;ve been feeling very inspired by it lately!</p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
