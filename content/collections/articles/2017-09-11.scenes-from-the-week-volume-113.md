<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

</a>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Saturday morning I was supposed to go to a spin class, but I just wasn&#8217;t feeling it, so I took a nice long solo walk around the river instead. The weather was fabulous &#8211; in the mid-70s which is not normal for September in Texas! While walking, I listened to the first episode of Serial. I know I&#8217;m really late to the game on this one! I thought it was really interesting, but I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m going to keep listening since I know the case is still unsolved, and I just can&#8217;t find a great time to listen to podcasts in my everyday life.</p>
<p>(2) We did a lot of small, quick meals this weekend, mostly because we were trying to eat through our pantry. One of those meals was a good, old-fashioned boxed mac &amp; cheese! Yes, it was Annie&#8217;s, and not Kraft, but it reminded me of my afternoon &#8220;snacks&#8221; in high school.</p>
<p>(3) Sunday afternoon we went to Bookpeople to get some work and blogging done.</p>
<p>(4) One night I had a mini at-home spa night with this face mask and this foot mask, while watching YouTube videos. So relaxing!</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending lots of thoughts and prayers to Daniel&#8217;s family in Miami and St. Petersburg, FL. As I write this, those areas are getting hit by Hurricane Irma. Thankfully, the St. Pete family evacuated to higher ground, but they are still in Tampa and need prayers.</li>
<li>Tuesday night dinner at Sway, a local Thai restaurant. A couple in our small group invited us out to the husband&#8217;s work dinner because they needed some more people to be able to get the 8-course group dinner, so we got to eat for free! What a treat!</li>
<li>Friday night dinner with our friends Caitlyn and Britton at Bonhomie. They had lots of good news to share, so it was so much fun to catch up on life!</li>
<li>Going to see Wind River for a movie date night Saturday. This movie hasn&#8217;t gotten a lot of attention, but we thought it was really good. It&#8217;s not a happy movie, but if you are looking for a good, suspenseful mystery with beautiful, snowy scenery, this is a good one for you!</li>
<li>Getting my annual shipment of Bath &amp; Body Works fall candles! Eeeks!</li>
<li>Feeling a bit under the weather all weekend. I still tried to make the most of a weekend at home though!</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
