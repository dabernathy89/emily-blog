<p>Each Monday night, I link up with <a href="http://thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to share my &#8220;wishes&#8221; or goals for the week and to see how I did on my goals last week.</p>
<p>I had a great weekend, but it was busy. Since the weekend is the time I&#8217;m usually able to work the most on my goals, I once again didn&#8217;t do too well on them.</p>
<h1>Last Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Start my spring cleaning by organizing and cleaning out our file cabinet. </strong>I was able to do this last night! It was so nice to get all of those old, unnecessary files thrown away.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Read half of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Workweek-Anywhere-Expanded/dp/0307465357" target="_blank">The 4-Hour Workweek</a>. </strong>I haven&#8217;t read half of it &#8211; more like one-third.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Do my usual exercise goal of going to the gym four times during the week.</strong> I went three times. Better than the past two weeks!</p>
<p>4. <strong>Finish my next <a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/category/travel-with-me/" target="_blank">travel post</a>.  </strong>No, I didn&#8217;t finish.</p>
<h1>This Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Continue spring cleaning by organizing our desk and the rest of our office nook.</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Finish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Workweek-Anywhere-Expanded/dp/0307465357" target="_blank">The 4-Hour Workweek</a>.</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>Do my usual exercise goal of going to the gym four times during the week.</strong> I went to BodyPump tonight, and I&#8217;m trying really hard to get up for 6am cycling in the morning! The hardest part will be getting myself to bed early enough tonight.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Finish my next <a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/category/travel-with-me/" target="_blank">travel post</a> or AT LEAST make good progress on it. </strong>Let&#8217;s try this again.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Write a letter or two to people I love &#8220;just because&#8221;.</strong> I love letters, and I don&#8217;t write them enough.</p>
