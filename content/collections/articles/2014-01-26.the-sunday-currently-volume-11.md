<p>The above picture is of last night&#8217;s dinner. It was so, so delicious! Obviously, it was not a healthy meal, but we declared yesterday a &#8220;cheat day&#8221;. Not that either of us are on a specific diet, but we have been focusing on limiting our calorie intake. Anyways, here is what I&#8217;m up to on this chilly Sunday&#8230;.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading</em>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Cuckoos-Calling-Robert-Galbraith/dp/0316206849" target="_blank">The Cuckoo&#8217;s Calling</a> by Robert Galbraith (aka J.K. Rowling). My &#8220;book club&#8221; met for brunch today to discuss <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Book-Thief-Markus-Zusak/dp/0375842209/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390767492&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+book+thief" target="_blank">The Book Thief </a>which I just finished this week for the second time. I absolutely loved it and gave it 5 stars on <a href="http://goodreads.com/" target="_blank">GoodReads</a>, but only two out of six of us in our group liked it. I recommend it if you don&#8217;t mind a story that starts out slowly with a lot of character building and isn&#8217;t a very happy read overall. I personally don&#8217;t mind slower stories, and for some reason I tend to like sad books, so it was definitely a good pick for me. And by slow, I don&#8217;t mean long and hard because, despite it&#8217;s 550-ish pages, it&#8217;s a fairly quick read. The next book for the book club is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Where-Leave-You-Novel/dp/0452296366/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390767800&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=where+i+leave+you" target="_blank">This is Where I Leave You</a> by Jonathan Topper, so I&#8217;ll be reading that soon as well.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>ideas for blog posts. I&#8217;m trying to crank out several posts this week so that I can schedule them for the first two weeks of February. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ve mentioned this on the blog, but February is the hardest month for me at work because I go to Memphis, TN for a long period of time to work on a huge project, and not much (if any) time is spent outside of the office.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to the music Starbucks is playing. Which is not very good, so I&#8217;ll probably pull up Pandora here pretty soon.</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I better start writing faster if I want to finish everything I had planned to do before my small group meeting tonight. I&#8217;m also thinking that I&#8217;m looking forward to nicer weather, not just because it will be great to spend time outdoors, but also because it will make our Sunday afternoon coffee shop time much easier when we don&#8217;t have to fight all of Northern Virginia for a seat. Before landing here at this Starbucks, we tried a local coffee shop and Barnes &amp; Noble, and both were completely packed.</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  coffee, of course</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> tomorrow was not Monday</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>the freezing cold weather leaves soon. Unless it will bring more snow&#8230;. I love snow!</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>a denim shirt, maroon legging cords, boots, and a coat. It&#8217;s cold in here.</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>my new hobbies! Blogging and Project Life have just added a whole new creative side to my daily life that I&#8217;ve never really had before. And, I&#8217;m reading more. What did I do with my free time before? Oh, that&#8217;s right, I watched TV&#8230;. I still do watch a lot of TV, but at least I can work on other things while I&#8217;m doing that.</p>
<p><em>Wanting </em> to organize our bedroom. Maybe this will be a spring project?</p>
<p><em>Needing  </em>to put on my headphones. This music is awful and not helping me write.</p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  happy</p>
