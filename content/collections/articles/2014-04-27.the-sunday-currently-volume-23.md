<p>This weekend Daniel&#8217;s twin brother was in town. It was a short visit, but we had a lot of fun while he was here. We went to a Nat&#8217;s game Thursday, and on Saturday, we took him to one of our favorite brunch spots in the afternoon, and he got to meet a lot of our friends at a housewarming party that evening. Before the party, Daniel and Jacob went out to do a brewery tour, and my friend Amanda came over to bake a very special cake! She had the fantastic idea to make a cake shaped like a house, and so we did (see above)! It was really fun to make, and everyone seemed to like it &#8211; especially the hosts of the party (Lauren &amp; Dave)!</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Film-Novel-Marisha-Pessl/dp/140006788X" target="_blank">Night Film</a>. This book is very addicting and slightly scary. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading quite a bit this afternoon and evening!</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>more London/Paris plans in our Trip Planning spreadsheet in Google Docs. Yes, we are nerds, and I love it.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>the Ed Sheeran Pandora station</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I have so much to look forward to and to be grateful for. We have had an excellent weekend, and I&#8217;m enjoying daydreaming about our future plans on this beautiful Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  the Bath and Body Works Sundrenched Vineyard candle. The whole apartment smells like Spring!</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> I could get out of this terrible habit of  spending Sunday dreading Monday rather than soaking in the beauty of this day of rest. Does anyone else have this problem?</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>that we are fully prepared for our trip in a week and a half!! My biggest fear is that we get to the airport and are asked for some documents (other than our passports) which we won&#8217;t have and then get turned away from boarding the plane!! I&#8217;ve double-checked UK and France visa and entry requirements, and we are good, but I&#8217;m still paranoid!</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>a t-shirt from my 2010 Uganda mission trip and cozy shorts</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> watching <a href="https://everydayaccountsblog.com/category/lazy-days-with-banana/" target="_blank">Banana</a> sunbathe. He loves the patch of sun that shines in from the window each afternoon. I just think it&#8217;s the cutest thing, but I may be slightly biased&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to use the hours this afternoon to the fullest. Oh, and I&#8217;m wanting to try out my new Urban Decay pencil eyeliner that I ordered from Sephora this afternoon. I&#8217;ve been loyal to my beloved Revlon ColorStay Eyeliner for many years, but lately I&#8217;ve been having trouble applying it without smudges or breaks in the line. I&#8217;ve heard so many good things about the Urban Decay 24/7 Glide-On Eye Pencil, so I&#8217;m really hoping for something that is quick and easy to apply to take with me on my trip.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to get back to the gym! I&#8217;m off-track (yet again).<br />

<p><em>Feeling</em>  very excited and very blessed</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>our trip-planning Google doc and lots of blogs<a href="https://twitter.com/siddathornton"><br />

<p>Enjoy your day!</p>
