<p><strong>Planning</strong> | Out some exciting upcoming weekends! Also, my parents got me an Inkwell Press Planner for my birthday, so I&#8217;m having fun filling that out. It doesn&#8217;t start until July, but I&#8217;ve jotted in a few future plans already!</p>
<p><strong>Enjoying</strong> |<i> </i> Indian food! I used to think I didn&#8217;t like Indian food, but now I love it! We enjoy going to The Clay Pit here in Austin to get dinner, and we&#8217;ve really loved picking up Trader Joe&#8217;s naan and chicken tikka masala. I think TJ&#8217;s frozen Indian meals are the best of their frozen meals we&#8217;ve tried.</p>
<p><b>Buying </b>| A couple fun items from Sephora this week with a birthday gift card. Looking forward to trying out <a href="http://www.sephora.com/perfect-hair-day-dry-shampoo-P399330?keyword=LIVING%20PROOF%20Perfect%20Hair%20Day%20Dry%20Shampoo%20P399330&amp;skuId=1722180&amp;_requestid=358029" target="_blank">this</a> dry shampoo and <a href="http://www.sephora.com/tartelette-in-bloom-clay-eyeshadow-palette-P403812?keyword=tartlette%20in%20bloom&amp;skuId=1775006&amp;_requestid=358225" target="_blank">this</a> beautiful eye shadow palette!</p>
<p><strong>Craving </strong>| Indian food. See above ^^! Also I&#8217;ve been seriously craving cheeseburgers from Shake Shack. And green olives&#8230; Always green olives&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Pinning</strong> | inspirational travel posts. Not for any future trip in particular, but just for future reference! There are some seriously amazing travel blog posts out there giving such great information.</p>
<p><strong>Reading</strong> | <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Three Wishes</span> by Liane Moriarty. I&#8217;m trying to read through a good chunk of Moriarty&#8217;s books before her new one comes out this summer! They are great summer reads.</p>
<p><strong>Watching</strong> | We just finished Broadchurch and are looking for another great mystery/thriller series on Netflix, so please give recommendations! Also, The Bachelorette. I like JoJo, but I feel like this season is kind of boring so far (and extra cheesy). Maybe it will get more interesting soon! I do think those Texas boys are pretty charming though&#8230;. 🙂</p>
<p><strong>Listening</strong> | To <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Rumor</span> by Elin Hilderbrand on Audible. Entertaining so far! Also, I&#8217;ve been adding several new songs to my Google Play &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; playlist that I&#8217;ve heard in my yoga class. I&#8217;ve picked up some great songs that I&#8217;d never heard before in the class. Right now, my favorite is John Mayer&#8217;s cover of Beyonce&#8217;s XO.</p>
