<p>I find so many great blog posts and articles online, so I&#8217;d like to start sharing that on the blog occasionally. I know there are lots of bloggers sharing links already, but I want to jump in anyway to share some of the great things I have found. I hope you enjoy!</p>
<p>// My favorite show Parenthood ended recently. I loved reading <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/parenthood-made-us-feel-so-many-emotions#.xdPbYAgJR" target="_blank">this article</a> about 19 of the best moments of the show. (If you don&#8217;t watch the show, you should. It&#8217;s on Netflix.)</p>
<p>// Anytime I&#8217;m on the bus or any public transportation, I try to sneak a peek of what books other people are reading. I find it so interesting to know what random people like to read and learn about. So, I loved looking through <a href="http://petapixel.com/2015/01/25/photographer-shoots-portrait-every-book-reader-spotted-subway/" target="_blank">these pictures</a> that a Dutch photographer took of people reading on the NYC subway over a period of three years.</p>
<p>// Oh, Pinterest&#8230;. I want to get more involved in this beloved form of social media, so I&#8217;ve saved <a href="http://www.oakandoats.com/2015/01/how-to-make-pinterest-work-for-you.html" target="_blank">this very useful post</a> on how to make Pinterest work for your blog. Hopefully, I can find an afternoon to put some of these tips into practice.</p>
<p>// Daniel and I recently started budgeting through the <a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/" target="_blank">You Need a Budget</a> software. <a href="http://wordsofwilliams.com/use-ynab-need-budget-monthly-basis/" target="_blank">These tips</a> by my favorite financial blogger have been really helpful as we have been getting set up!</p>
<p>// <a href="http://modernmrsdarcy.com/2015/01/winter-reading-list/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ModernMrsDarcy+%28modern+Mrs.+Darcy%29" target="_blank">This list of books</a> makes me want to jump into a cozy arm chair by the fire and spend an entire day reading (with a warm beverage, of course).</p>
<p>// One of my favorite travel bloggers posted <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/what-if-we-live-the-same-way-we-travel/" target="_blank">this truly inspiring video</a> that makes me excited to get out and enjoy my own city. Traveling is great, but there is so much to see right outside our homes in our everyday lives. It&#8217;s all about perspective. &#8220;It is up to us to hurl ourselves into our next adventure &#8211; seeing the small things big and the big things small.&#8221;</p>
