<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

We&#8217;ve had a fantastic Christmas and full week before, even though it was not a very traditional Christmas. We went on a Bahamas cruise and then spent Christmas weekend in Fort Lauderdale, FL with my in-laws and some of Daniel&#8217;s extended family. While it really didn&#8217;t feel like Christmas on the beach in the Bahamas or in the Florida heat, it was certainly a good time spent with family.</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Norwegian Cruise Lines has a private island in the Bahamas, so we stopped there on day two of the cruise. It was definitely my favorite stop &#8211; the sand was extra smooth, the crowds were small, and the water was extremely blue. We spent the morning on the beach and the afternoon on a snorkeling excursion.</p>
<p>(2) This picture was taken on a beach in Freeport, our third day&#8217;s stop. I wasn&#8217;t very impressed with Freeport itself (the part we saw was all cheesy touristy shops and industrial construction sites), but the beach we ended up on after a 20 minute taxi ride was a good one!</p>
<p>(3) It was fun to see hints of Christmas throughout the Bahamas. 🙂</p>
<p>(4) Our rental house in Fort Lauderdale sat right on a lake used by a water skiing school. It was fun to watch the boats and water skiing students go by on skis during the day, and the sunsets were beautiful in the evenings.</p>

<li>Going to see the new Star Wars movie on Christmas Day</li>
<li>Ordering Lara Casey&#8217;s Power Sheets &#8211; I&#8217;m going to be doing some thinking and planning for the New Year this week after we get home, and I&#8217;m excited to finally use these as a planning tool!</li>
<li>Finishing up a couple of books (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everyone-Brave-Forgiven-Chris-Cleave/dp/1501124374" target="_blank">Everyone Brave is Forgiven</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-True-Love-Gave-Me/dp/1250059313/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482712413&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=my+true+love+gave+to+me" target="_blank">My True Love Gave to Me</a>)</li>
