<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>(1) We went to a fun wine tasting event at a nearby local restaurant. Since we were finished at the event much earlier than planned, we caved and ended up having dinner there, even though we were supposed to do something quick that night. What can I say? The delicious Italian food was calling us!</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">(2) We kicked off the weekend with dinner at Moonshine with our friends Allison and Ross. Allison and I were best friends in sixth grade, and ever since she moved away that year, we have only spoken occasionally. Now we are starting to hang out more, and it&#8217;s like we never stopped! </span></p>
<p>(3) I wish I had gotten another picture of our Saturday night, but this blurry screenshot from Snapchat will have to do! We enjoyed an evening of dinner and a comedy show with our friends. We love hanging out with Kaelin and Andres!</p>
<p>(4) On Sunday, I had lots of blogging to do, so we headed to a favorite coffee shop to hunker down and get things done.</p>

<li>A productive Saturday morning and afternoon spent cleaning and getting home projects done</li>
