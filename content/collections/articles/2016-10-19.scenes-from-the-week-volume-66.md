<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m free!!! After Monday, work has finally slowed down a bit, and I have time to do other things besides sit at my desk hunched over my laptop. Because of all that work, I don&#8217;t have any pictures to share this week, but I did want to share a few highlights:</p>
<p>(1) Going out for dinner and a movie at Alamo Drafthouse to  celebrate the end of my big project. We saw The Girl on the Train which was a bit weird and not as good as the book, but it was still a good thriller.</p>
<p>(2) A nice Sunday morning of meeting up with our new small group at church and then going for brunch at True Food Kitchen</p>
<p>(3) Watching You&#8217;ve Got Mail for the first time in years &#8211; it&#8217;s such a perfect fall movie!</p>
<p>(4) Lighting my Bath &amp; Body Works Pumpkin Pie candle. I look forward to this all year!</p>
