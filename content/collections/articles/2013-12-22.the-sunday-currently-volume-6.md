<p>We are in Waco, Texas with my family now. It has been so good to spend time with them so far, and we have almost a week left before we go visit Daniel&#8217;s family in Aledo.  Today is actually pretty busy, but I wanted to squeeze in a quick Sunday post!</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading</em>  still <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Ruins-Novel-Jess-Walter/dp/0061928178" target="_blank">Beautiful Ruins</a>. I have to finish by tomorrow because it is a library digital copy, and it expires from my Nook tomorrow evening. The book is good so far, but it is a slow plot line that is not easy to read in the small amounts of free time that I&#8217;ve had during the busy past couple of weeks.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>nothing but this post. It&#8217;s a busy day!</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/myhousewifelife?feature=g-subs-u" target="_blank">MyHouseWifeLife </a>video. Just a fun &#8220;day-in-the-life&#8221; YouTube channel I recently discovered.</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I&#8217;m looking forward to the Baylor basketball game this afternoon and a Christmas carol service at my grandparents&#8217; church this evening.</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  my Vanilla Bean Noel lotion</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> that time would slow down during the remainder of the holiday season. It&#8217;s flying by!! I&#8217;m trying to savor every moment.</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to squeeze in a quick nap before the basketball game</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>pajama pants and a cozy t-shirt</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> being with my family</p>
<p><em>Wanting </em> my snuggly kitty here with me in Texas</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> this time off from work. I&#8217;m so thankful it&#8217;s here!</p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  excited to see more family members as they fly in throughout the next few days.</p>
