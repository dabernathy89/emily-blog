<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts  help serve that purpose.</p>

I was able to do lots of reading, new year planning, and closet cleaning. There were, of course, plenty of things I had planned to do that I wasn&#8217;t able to get to, but that&#8217;s okay. The terrible cold I had before came back in full force on Friday morning, just in time for Heather and Cody&#8217;s weekend visit. Heather and Cody are some of our very best friends from college, so I was pretty bummed to be sick while they were here. We made the most of it and had an enjoyable, relaxing weekend together. They left this morning, and I&#8217;m already missing them! 🙁</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Using the KonMari Method from <a href="http://amzn.to/2CDZrUJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a>, I did a clear out of my clothing in my drawers and closet. It&#8217;s amazing how, even though we have moved five times during the nearly seven years of our marriage, I still managed to fill up four large trash bags of donations and one large trash bag of trash. And that is just clothing (my clothing &#8211; I did not even touch my husband&#8217;s). I also used the author&#8217;s method of folding to put things back into my drawers, and I&#8217;ve never had such beautifully organized drawers before! I&#8217;d like to use her method to continue clearing out various items in my home before Baby Boy arrives.</p>
<p>(2) This picture shows where I was most of the week when I wasn&#8217;t sick in bed, spending time with Heather and Cody, or cleaning out my closet. I spent lots of time on the couch reading and planning, in yoga pants with no makeup, and with a furry little acrobat by my side. 🙂 I&#8217;m actually meal planning in this picture.</p>
<p>(3) After church and lunch on Sunday, we took Heather and Cody for a quick walk up Mt. Bonnell for a nice view of Lake Austin and the surrounding beautiful homes and hill country. We got this great photo of them while we were up there!</p>
<p>(4) Daniel received the board game <a href="http://amzn.to/2AHAYfn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Castles of Burgundy</a> for Christmas this year, and he has claimed that it is now his favorite game. I&#8217;m not a huge board game fan, so I had been putting off playing it with him until this weekend. I ended up playing a couple rounds of the game with him, Heather, and Cody on Sunday. After getting the hang of a specific strategy, I had a great time playing! If you like board games similar to <a href="http://amzn.to/2CETUx8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Settlers of Catan</a>, I think you will like this one.</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading and loving Anne Bogel&#8217;s book <a href="http://amzn.to/2qCkk0W" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reading People: How Seeing the World through the Lens of Personality Changes Everything</a>. I honestly did not expect to love this book, but I ended up giving it five stars on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3071331-emily" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goodreads</a>, which is a rare occurrence for me. I love how Anne provides a nice summary of several of the major personality assessments. I&#8217;ve been fascinated about personalities and learning how different types interact with each other (in both healthy and unhealthy ways), but I&#8217;ve put off reading many books on them because the amount of material out there is overwhelming. Anne gives great summaries as well as a wonderful list of references for further learning in the back of the book. I&#8217;m looking forward to diving more into the Enneagram and the five love languages. (P.S. I&#8217;m playing with the idea of writing about what books I read each month and my thoughts. I don&#8217;t feel that I do a great job describing books, but I could try and do my best! Any thoughts?)</li>
<li>Going to spin class three times this week. I love going to Define Fitness here in my apartment building. SUCH a great, motivating workout!</li>
<li>Taking Heather and Cody to the gorgeous new Downtown Austin library, Terry Black&#8217;s BBQ (along with our friends John and Amber!), and Ramen Tatsu-ya.</li>
<li>Cracking open the Annie&#8217;s Organic Cinnamon Rolls for our Saturday morning breakfast. Holy moly, those were the best cinnamon rolls from a can I&#8217;ve ever had! Yum!</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that everyone has a great week!</p>
