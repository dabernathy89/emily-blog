It has been a little less than a year since I shared a list of books I want to read. My goal with these posts is to get some feedback on my selections: Have you read any of them and liked them? Hated them? Have any recommendations of something I just have to add to the list? Those kinds of things. Also, making a list always motivates me, so it will encourage me to read more quickly through the list. I think I&#8217;ll do these posts seasonally. Since my last post like this, I&#8217;ve also begun listening to audio books, so this list covers both audio books that I&#8217;ll listen to and actual books I&#8217;ll read. Here is what I plan to read over the next three months or so:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Luckiest-Girl-Alive-A-Novel/dp/1476789630" target="_blank">Luckiest Girl Alive</a> by Jessica Knoll &#8211; This is a mystery novel that I&#8217;ve seen compared to Gone Girl. I love a good mystery, so I thought I&#8217;d give it a shot.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Searching-Sunday-Loving-Leaving-Finding/dp/0718022122/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435343764&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=searching+or+sunday" target="_blank">Searching for Sunday: Loving, Leaving, and Finding the Church</a> by Rachel Held Evans &#8211; I have been very interested in reading this story on the author&#8217;s journey to find the church. I&#8217;ve heard that it&#8217;s a powerful and thoughtful read.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Station-Eleven-Emily-John-Mandel/dp/0804172447/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435340609&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=station+eleven" target="_blank">Station Eleven</a> by Emily St. John Mandel &#8211; I haven&#8217;t read many dystopian novels lately, but I&#8217;ve always thought they were fun. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading this one. It just came out earlier this month but already has a lot of great review.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Machu-Picchu-Guidebook-Self-Guided-Tour/dp/1555663273/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435340900&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=machu+picchu+books" target="_blank">The Machu Picchu Guidebook: A Self-Guided Tour</a> by Ruth M. Wright &#8211; We are leaving for Peru in just a few weeks! I love to learn about the places I&#8217;m visiting before I travel to them so that I can really appreciate what I&#8217;m seeing. I can&#8217;t wait to read through this book once it arrives and then take it around with us as we explore the ruins of Machu Picchu. I saw it highly recommended on many different travel boards, so I snagged it on eBay whenever I saw it was sold out on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Better-Than-Before-Mastering-Everyday/dp/0385348614/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435341169&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=better+than+before" target="_blank">Better Than Before</a> by Gretchen Rubin &#8211; I&#8217;ve read and enjoyed Gretchen Rubin&#8217;s other two books, so I thought I&#8217;d read this one as well. This book is about developing habits. I found her other books very inspiring, so I&#8217;m hoping to get some inspiration from this book as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everything-I-Never-Told-You/dp/0143127551/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435343201&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=everything+i+never+told+you" target="_blank">Everything I Never Told You</a> by Celeste Ng &#8211; I first heard about this book on <a href="http://modernmrsdarcy.com/2015-summer-reading-guide/" target="_blank">Modern Mrs. Darcy&#8217;s Summer Reading Guide</a>. Anne, the writer at Modern Mrs. Darcy, has great taste in books, so I&#8217;m sure this one will not disappoint.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Still-Life-Chief-Inspector-Gamache/dp/0312948557" target="_blank">Still Life: A Chief Inspector Gamanche Novel</a> &#8211; This is the first book in a mystery series that I&#8217;ve been interested in reading for a while. I have not read a book series for a long time, but I&#8217;d like to. Series are a fun way to really get to know the characters, so I&#8217;m excited to dive into this one if I like the first book.</p>
<p>Unknown &#8211; I&#8217;d like to read one or two more books before the end of summer. Any suggestions? I&#8217;d be really interested to add another nonfiction or historical fiction to the list, but I&#8217;d love to get any thoughts here.</p>
