<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>(1) Our last day of Whole30 was Monday! We made it! I feel good and healthy, and I&#8217;m so glad I did it. I would consider doing it again &#8211; maybe pre- or post-vacation. However, for now, I am excited to get back to eating some of my favorite foods, in moderation, of course! We took a few days to try and reintroduce foods slowly back into our diet (although definitely not as slowly as Whole30 suggests), but Friday night, we had a date night at our favorite local Italian restaurant, Juliet!</p>
<p>(2) Saturday lunch was at Forthright Cafe, a new local spot, and I had one of the best avocado toasts I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>
<p>(3) Sunday we went to brunch with friends after church at Walton&#8217;s, Sandra Bullock&#8217;s restaurant here in town. The restaurant is so cute, and the food was amazing! They have a beautiful florist shop in the back. I can&#8217;t believe we had never been there before. I mean, just look at their garden section!</p>
<p>(4) We decided to keep the Super Bowl very low-key this year and stay home with some Kirbey queso and some local drinks. It was a really relaxing evening, and, my goodness, that game was exciting, even if my team pick didn&#8217;t win&#8230;.</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visiting Kaelin and Andres for breakfast in their new house on Saturday! They picked up Texas Honey Ham breakfast tacos for us, and dare I say they were better than Taco Deli? (Gasp!)</li>
<li>Going out to Arugs Cidery for local cider and Pieous for neopolitan pizza with John and Amber!</li>
<li>Trying out Vintage Heart Coffee for our Sunday working session</li>
<li>Getting through a really good work out streak this week &#8211; three spin classes and three <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene" target="_blank">Yoga With Adriene </a>videos. I hope I can keep it up into this week!</li>
<li>Daniel healing up really nicely from his surgery <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2017/01/scenes-from-the-week-volume-81/" target="_blank">last week</a>. He is almost completely back to normal, except he can&#8217;t exercise for another week. Thanks for all of your kind words last week!</li>

<li>While in Switzerland, we visited a winter wonderland fairytale! I shared how to explore some mountaintop <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2017/01/travel-with-me-bernese-oberland-by-cable-car/" target="_blank">Swiss villages by cable car </a>on the blog last week.</li>
