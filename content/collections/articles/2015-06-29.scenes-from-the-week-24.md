<p>Happy Monday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these quick posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events.</p>

<p>Clockwise starting at the top left:</p>
<p>(1) This weekend was full of delicious meals around Austin. This cheese board was the start of our Sunday brunch at Henri&#8217;s, a cute little cheese and wine shop down the road from us. I had a grilled cheese and soup and Daniel had a  fried egg sandwich as the rest of our meal. I highly recommend this place if you are in the Austin area.</p>
<p>(2) Sunday we made it out on Lady Bird Lake for some kayaking! It was a beautiful morning. While the water in the lake isn&#8217;t the cleanest or most beautiful, the gorgeous green trees and all of the people out on the water with us made for a fun experience.</p>
<p>(3) This was a double brunch kind of weekend. Saturday&#8217;s brunch involved these olive oil pancakes&#8230;. They were as good as they look.</p>
<p>(4) Friday night we had dinner out with my sister and her boyfriend and then we went to a comedy show downtown. I thought these light fixtures at the restaurant were cool.</p>

<li>We visited the Hops &amp; Grain brewery Saturday evening. It was really noisy, but the tour was very interesting. It is fun to support and learn about local businesses here in Austin.</li>
<li>I caught up with Kaitlin (great friend from DC), and it was so fun to talk about our upcoming adventures!</li>
<li>I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nightingale-Kristin-Hannah/dp/0312577222/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435591892&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+nightingale" target="_blank">The Nightingale</a> by Kristin Hannah. I cannot recommend it enough! It is a beautiful story about two sisters in France during the Nazi occupation. Be sure to grab the tissue box&#8230;.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m definitely in the mood to read these days &#8211; I&#8217;m tearing through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Luckiest-Girl-Alive-Jessica-Knoll/dp/1476789630/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435591613&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+luckiest+girl+alive" target="_blank">The Luckiest Girl Alive</a> right now. It&#8217;s not my favorite, but it&#8217;s keeping me interested enough to keep reading. Click <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2015/06/summer-reading-list/" target="_blank">here</a> to see what I plan to read the rest of the summer, and let me know if you have any suggestions!</li>

<p>Happy Monday! Have a great week!</p>
