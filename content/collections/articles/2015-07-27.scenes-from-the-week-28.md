<p>Happy Monday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these quick posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

Clockwise starting at the top left:</p>
<p>(1) During our weekend getaway, we stopped at Stonehenge II in Ingram, TX, a very interesting replica of the real monument.</p>
<p>(2) To get around Mo Ranch, there are a couple of cat walks to cross. I thought that they looked really neat in the middle of the Texas trees.</p>
<p>(3) The view from Mo&#8217;s Inspiration Point at dusk was stunning. I wish that the image did the view justice, but it just doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>(4) We spent Sunday morning in Fredericksburg. This is the friendly welcome we received at lunch.</p>
<p>This past weekend was another weekend well-spent. After a long week at work, we packed up our bags to escape to the Hill Country. Daniel grew up going to church camp at Mo Ranch, a Presbyterian retreat in Hunt, Texas. He has been wanting to take me there for years, so we picked this weekend to go. Mo Ranch is a beautiful, peaceful place. In addition to Daniel showing me around to all his favorite spots, we swam in the river, ate delicious BBQ and cornbread muffins, and found a great viewpoint to watch the sunset. We also drove into Kerrville for lunch and my first Culver&#8217;s custard experience (yum!), and, on our way home Sunday, we stopped in Fredericksburg to window shop in the cute stores and grab some lunch. We made one more stop closer to Austin at Pedernales Cellars for a wine tasting and gorgeous view of the Hill Country.</p>
<p>We had a great weekend. It is hard to see it go, but now it&#8217;s time to get ready for our big trip to Peru! We leave on Friday, and I could not be more excited.</p>
<p>Happy Monday! Have a great week!</p>
