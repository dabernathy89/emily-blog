<p>Twice a month I link up with <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to join the community of bloggers who share their goals for the week in the Weekly Wishes link-up. I&#8217;m continuing to update my goals for the entire month twice a month rather than having a new set of goals each week. Right now, thinking about my to-dos in this big picture format has been working the best for me.</p>
<h2>August Goals</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Get as far as  I can in the <a title="Semi-Charmed Summer 2014 Book Challenge" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/05/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge/" target="_blank">summer reading challenge</a> I&#8217;m participating in.</strong> I&#8217;m not doing too well at this one. I haven&#8217;t even finished one book this month yet. It&#8217;s sad but true! I blame it on the later nights at the office and my inability to read at night in bed without drifting off to sleep.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Organize our linen closet. </strong>Not yet! But I really want to get this done. I think my first step will be to compile all of my organizational tools that I already have and figure out if there are any other crates/boxes/plastic drawers/etc. that I should purchase. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>3.<strong> Write and post all of my Paris <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/travel-with-me/" target="_blank">Travel With Me</a> posts.</strong> Well, the first one should be going up this week! That&#8217;s a start&#8230;.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Start and complete a SkillShare class (or two). </strong>Now that I have weekends at home for a while, I&#8217;d really like to get into these classes. It&#8217;s such a great opportunity to learn new things outside of work. I haven&#8217;t made much progress on this one yet, but I plan to make it a priority once I wrap up my first Paris post.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Starting today, post a daily photo on Instagram.</strong> I&#8217;ve been doing fairly well on this one. I&#8217;ve missed a couple days here and there, but I&#8217;ve posted plenty! It has been a lot of fun looking for little things each day that I can share with others.</p>
<p>So, overall, I have not made much progress. Looks like I&#8217;ll need to be really intentional with my time during the second half of the month!</p>
