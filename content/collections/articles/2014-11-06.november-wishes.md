<p>Twice a month I link up with <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to join the community of bloggers who share their goals for the week in the Weekly Wishes link-up. I&#8217;m continuing to update my goals for the entire month twice a month rather than having a new set of goals each week. Right now, thinking about my to-dos in this big picture format has been working the best for me.</p>
<p>First, I will go through how I did on my October goals, and then I will share what I hope to accomplish in November.</p>
<h2>October Goals</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Finish that <a href="http://www.artifactuprising.com/site/home" target="_blank">Artifact Uprising</a> book for our London &amp; Paris trip. </strong>I finished this and ordered it!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Do a SkillShare class.</strong> Hahaha&#8230;. Maybe I should just cancel my membership because as much as I say I want to do these, I have not been making the time for them.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Get back into reading regularly.</strong> I feel like I accomplished this with a good mix of regular books and audio books this month.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Make the bed everyday.</strong> I&#8217;m  proud to say that I made the bed every single morning I was home in October! I hope to keep up with the habit.</p>
<h2>November Goals</h2>
<p>1. <strong>With all of our travel, remember to take lots of pictures to share on the blog and use in my Project Life album.</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Make a pumpkin pie. </strong>It&#8217;s the best time of year to make my favorite dessert!</p>
<p>3. <strong>Don&#8217;t put off my travel posts this month. </strong>We have several short trips this month, and I want to write about them right away.</p>
<p>4.<strong> In addition to audio books, read two books.</strong> There are so many good books to read in the world!</p>
<p>5. <strong>Use the Day One app every day.</strong> I discovered this app recently, and I love it! You add a picture with notes for each day, so you can easily keep track of daily life. I&#8217;m excited to use this to help both with my <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/scenes-from-the-week/" target="_blank">Scenes From the Week</a> posts and my Project Life albums. It&#8217;s really easy to forget the little things that make each day special without writing them down.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! I&#8217;m excited about each of these goals.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently in the Chicago area for a work training. There is not much going on here other than very full days of classes (we don&#8217;t ever leave the training center since our rooms are in the same building as the dining area and the classes), so I probably won&#8217;t have anything to share in a Scenes From the Week post this week. So, I&#8217;m going ahead and wishing everyone a happy weekend!</p>
