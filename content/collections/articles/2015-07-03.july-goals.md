<h2>June Review</h2>
<h3>Finish the <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/courses/make-your-dream-trip-reality-chris-guillebeau-stephanie-zito" target="_blank">Make Your Dream Trip a Reality</a> online course.</h3>
<p>Done! This course is great. It is so full of practical tips on how you can get SO MUCH free travel. It can definitely be a reality. We already have TONS of points and miles by using tips and tricks that this course teaches. I don&#8217;t think that we will be paying for a flight for a long time.</p>
<h3>Get back into a workout routine.</h3>
<p>I went down to our apartment gym a few times this month, but I wouldn&#8217;t call it a routine. I got so used to doing group classes at my gym in DC, so doing a solo workout on the elliptical each morning is just&#8230;. boring. See below in my July goals for what I&#8217;m going to try doing this month.</p>
<h3>Get plugged back in to the blogging community.</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m definitely getting there! I&#8217;ve gotten back into participating in The Peony Project on Facebook, reading and commenting regularly on other blogs, and learning how to improve my blog. I love this community!</p>
<h3>Get set up on my new Macbook Air.</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m typing on the new laptop right now! I&#8217;m beginning to really love using a Mac. I use a PC at work, so it&#8217;s a little tricky switching between the two, but I think I&#8217;m getting the hang of it. I haven&#8217;t figured out a good photo editing system yet &#8211; I have all my iPhone pictures sync to my Dropbox account, so I&#8217;m trying to figure out a way to edit my photos directly in Dropbox without having to make a duplicate copy. It&#8217;s harder than it sounds&#8230;. Does anyone else do this and have tips for me?</p>
<h2>July Goals</h2>
<h3>Keep up with our purchases daily in our budgeting software.</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been on again and off again with keeping up with a budget. We use the <a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/" target="_blank">YNAB</a> software which I really love, but it does require that you record and categorize each of your individual purchases (unlike Mint which automatically syncs with your accounts). Back in February when I first started using YNAB, I made it a weekly goal to record our purchases, but it would take way too long on Sunday evenings to get through them all. As daunting as it sounds, I think it will be much easier to spend five minutes at the end of each day recording our purchases for that day. I likely will miss some days, but catching up for a couple of days will take far less time than recording a full week.</p>
<h3>Try a different approach to getting into a workout routine.</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, I&#8217;m already bored with doing my morning workouts in our apartment gym. Just this morning, I started looking into doing the <a href="http://www.blogilates.com/blog/2014/12/30/new-beginners-calendar-2-0-for-2015/" target="_blank">Blogilates Beginner&#8217;s 2.0 Calendar</a>. It seems like just what I need right now &#8211; it has a calendar where I can check things off, all I need is a yoga mat, I can do it right in my own home, and there are plenty of other calendars that I can use in the future if I decide I like this format. Basically, I&#8217;m just looking for something to do while I wait for the new cycling and yoga studio to open up across the street from us later this fall. I think this is a great solution!</p>
<h3>Get through six more months of my 2014 Project Life album.</h3>
<p>Last year around June, I completely set aside work on my Project Life album for nearly a year. Well, I&#8217;m back into it, and I&#8217;m determined to catch up and complete my 2014 album! I did two months in June, and I hope to finish out the year in July! It sounds ambitious, but since I started using the <a href="http://www.digitalprojectlife.com/" target="_blank">digital version</a> on an app on my iPad, it&#8217;s much quicker and just as a cute. Once I&#8217;m done, I hope to share my full album on the blog!</p>
<h3>Find a comfortable, waterproof jacket for our trip to Peru.</h3>
<p>We leave July 31, and I currently don&#8217;t own an outdoor jacket like this. Does anyone have any favorites? I know that some of them can get expensive, so I was hoping to get some ideas. I&#8217;m looking for something to keep warm (but not too warm!) since it&#8217;s winter in Peru, and it needs to be waterproof and good for hiking.</p>
<h3>Clean out my closet.</h3>
<p>I just did this when we moved six months ago, but I already know I need to do it again. We don&#8217;t have much closet space in our tiny one-bedroom apartment, and there are plenty of items in my closet that I have not worn once since the move.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be a good July! I hope that everyone has a great and relaxing holiday weekend!</p>
