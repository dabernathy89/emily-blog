<p>June is over. Actually, we are almost halfway through July! I&#8217;m going to join the rest of the world (again) by saying that I am in shock how quickly 2014 is going. Life, won&#8217;t you slow down already?</p>
<h2>Book</h2>
<h3 class="parseasinTitle "><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Keepers-Daughter-Novel/dp/0143037145" target="_blank">The Memory Keeper&#8217;s Daughter</a> by Kim Edwards</h3>
<p>I was able to read three books in June. My favorite of the three was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Memory Keeper&#8217;s Daughter</span>. This book surprised me &#8211; I didn&#8217;t expect to love it. The reviews were not above average, and the plot sounded interesting but not fantastic. I honestly just picked it out because it was the first book that came to mind to qualify for one of the categories in the <a title="Semi-Charmed Summer 2014 Book Challenge" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/05/01/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge/" target="_blank">summer reading challenge</a> I&#8217;m doing. But I loved it! Edwards has a beautiful writing style. I found myself absorbed in the story and reading hundreds of pages at a time without putting it down. While the ending wasn&#8217;t what I was hoping for, it does wrap up nicely. I highly recommend you add this to your summer reading list.</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<h3>OneRepublic</h3>
<p>Yes, I know OneRepublic has been popular for years. But before this summer, I never really liked many of their songs I heard on the radio. Then my co-workers invited me to join them at the OneRepublic concert, and that changed it all for me! I can&#8217;t stop listening to their newest album <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Native</span>. I love the song &#8220;I Lived&#8221; &#8211; Ryan Tedder (lead singer of the band) wrote this song for his four-year-old son; it&#8217;s all about living life to the fullest, and I find it very inspiring.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.skinnycow.com/products/detail.aspx?id=44" target="_blank">Skinny Cow Snickerdoodle Cookies</a></h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a picture of these because I made myself stop buying them to prevent devouring them everyday, but click the link to take a look. Basically, a Snickerdoodle Skinny Cow is an ice cream sandwich with cinnamon ice cream between two oatmeal cookies. And somehow, this magical little dessert is only 140 calories! It&#8217;s pretty fantastic &#8211; especially for summertime!</p>
<h2>Beauty/Skincare</h2>

<h3>Stila In The Light Eyeshadow Palette</h3>
<p>For my birthday, I received some spending money from family members. Thanks to their generosity, I was able to buy this palette and the Lush Ocean Salt Scrub (see below). I had been eyeing this palette for a while, and I&#8217;m so glad I got it! I wore it throughout all of June, and I think I&#8217;ll be constantly wearing it year-round. I&#8217;ll admit, I&#8217;ve only really used the lighter colors, but I&#8217;m hoping to become a little more adventurous by trying out some looks with the darker colors for special occasions soon.</p>
<h3>Lush Ocean Salt Face &amp; Body Scrub</h3>
<p>I had heard so many great things about this scrub before buying it. Now that I have it, I wish I could continually repurchase it! It smells AMAZING &#8211; lime and coconut and vanilla and all the best summer scents in one. The lady in the store told me it was &#8220;like a margarita for your body&#8221;, and she was right! The sea salt provides a really good scrub for your face and your body. My skin feels so soft after using it. My only complaint is that you have to use a lot of product to scrub your whole body since the sea salt dissolves so quickly. This means if you use it regularly, it won&#8217;t last long. I have been using it about twice a week for one month, and my 8.8oz container is nearly empty. I don&#8217;t think I will repurchase for now because of the price &#8211; $36! While I definitely loved using it this month, I just can&#8217;t justify paying that much for a product that only lasts a month or two. I do plan to treat myself to it occasionally in the future though!</p>
<h2>Tech</h2>
<h3>Starbucks App</h3>
<p>I have been using the Starbucks app for a while. I love how easy the app is to use. You just open it up, shake your phone, and the bar code pops up. Every Starbucks I have ever been too will now accept payment with this app. At first, I was worried that the automatic re-fill feature would encourage me to buy too much Starbucks, but I have figured out the perfect system to make it work in my favor. Since I&#8217;m a Starbucks gold member, I get every 12th drink free. Since I love their Blonde Roast regular coffee, I almost always order that so that I&#8217;m not spending $4-6 every time I go. Even though this is a much cheaper purchase than most of their drinks, it still counts as one of the twelve stars toward a free drink on my app. With my husband and I sharing the same account, we get free drinks fairly often, so it&#8217;s fun to treat ourselves to some of the more exciting cappuccinos, frappuccinos, and lattes with those free drinks that we earn.</p>

<h2>Blog</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.siddathornton.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Siddathornton</a></h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of Lauren&#8217;s blog for a while now. She took somewhat of a break from blogging for a bit, but then she recently came back in full force by blogging every single day in June. Now she has released her new posting schedule, and I&#8217;m excited to see that she plans to continue blogging regularly! She has a gift for making the simple things in life seem magical. I also think that she and I have very similar interests which naturally makes me more interested in what she has to say. I&#8217;ve been linking up with her all year with The Sunday Currently link-up that she hosts, and I have found many of my other favorite bloggers through the link-up. You should definitely hop on over and click through some of her posts <a href="http://www.siddathornton.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
