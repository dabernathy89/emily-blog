<p>Last Saturday, Spring was in the air in DC. It was a beautiful 65 degrees, and we decided it would be a shame to stay indoors working all day. So we made plans to meet good friends at Union Market in DC for a long lunch. We were especially eager to get out because Snowstorm Wiley was on his way to meet us the following Monday morning.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t actually realize that the market was indoors, but it was still a great way to enjoy the weather because they opened up all the entryways to let the fresh air in. The market is made up of a variety of food stands, a few cute shops, and one sit-down restaurant, all in a big warehouse-type building.</p>

<p>The flower stand had some really pretty options that made me even more excited for Spring!</p>

<p>One of the shops inside the market, Salt and Sundry, sold all types of homegood items along with stationery, craft items, and a fabulous candle selection. It reminded me a lot of Anthropologie without the clothes (unfortunately, it was priced the same as well).</p>

<p>We enjoy brunch at Bidwell Restaurant. It was a long wait but that is expected for brunch on a Saturday.</p>

<p>I ordered a spinach, goat cheese, and mushroom omelette with sides of potato hash and salad. Yum!</p>

<p>What trip to a market is complete without some ice cream in the sun?</p>

<p>Or some empanadas to take home and eat for dinner later?</p>

<p>Before we left, we stopped at the No. 1 Son&#8217;s  pickle stand to get some District Dills and Teaism to get a new tea to try. It was a great day, and we look forward to going back to try out some of the other tasty food stands!</p>
