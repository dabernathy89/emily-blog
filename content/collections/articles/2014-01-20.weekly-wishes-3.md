<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">It&#8217;s that time again! I&#8217;m really enjoying having Monday nights to plan out what I want to make sure I accomplish for the rest of the week. It really helps me use any free evenings at home and my weekends wisely.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">Starting this week, I&#8217;m going to begin these posts by taking a look back on my wishes from the previous week to see how I did.</p>
<div style="text-align:left;" align="center"></div>
<h1 style="text-align:left;" align="center">Last Week</h1>
<p><strong>1. Read half of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Book-Thief-Markus-Zusak/dp/0375842209/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389665058&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+book+thief" target="_blank">The Book Thief</a>.  &#8211; </strong>I did not finish half, but I was close! I&#8217;ve made a reading plan for the rest of the week to make sure I finish in time for my book club meeting this Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Make it to my 6am cycling class Tuesday morning.</strong> &#8211; I did make it! And it felt so good to get my workout done in the morning.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Set up my Project Life album and get it ready to start my first page. &#8211; </strong>Done! I can tell I&#8217;m going to really enjoy this new hobby.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Put all of our Christmas decoration containers back out in our storage unit.</strong> &#8211; We did this before our trip to Philly this weekend. It&#8217;s nice to have a less-cluttered apartment!</p>
<p>5.<strong> &#8220;Finalize&#8221; our budget.</strong> &#8211; I worked quite a bit on our budget and updating our You Need a Budget software. I&#8217;ve decided that it will take a few months for it to be in a more final state since I&#8217;m not exactly sure what some of our spending patterns for this year will be yet.</p>
<h1>This Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Set up my new planner. &#8211; </strong>I bought some colored pens and can&#8217;t wait to put my new planner together to help me stay organized for the rest of 2014.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Read the rest of the Book Thief. &#8211; </strong>I think I&#8217;ve talked about this enough, but it is definitely a priority for me this week.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Make it to  6am cycling class tomorrow and Wednesday morning, BodyPump Thursday evening, yoga on Saturday, and BodyPump again on Sunday. </strong>&#8211; I basically want this to be my routine any week I&#8217;m home this year.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Get a good chunk of my next<a title="Travel with Me // New England (Part I)" href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/2013/11/21/travel-with-me-new-england-part-i/"> Travel with Me</a> post written and ready to post next week. </strong></p>
<p>5. <b>Get pictures printed for my first Project Life layout. &#8211; </b>This is the next step after getting the whole album set up and the first step of creating a layout.</p>
