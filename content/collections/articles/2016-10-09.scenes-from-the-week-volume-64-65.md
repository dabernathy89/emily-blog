<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

I wanted to pop in for a little catch up Scenes From the Week for the past couple weeks. I really hope to be back with travel-related content starting next week.</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Two weekends ago we went to our first ACL Festival! It was a lot of fun. My favorite acts were Mumford &amp; Songs, Frightened Rabbit, and M83.</p>
<p>(2) I joined Gilmore Girls fans all over the country and visited the pop-up Luke&#8217;s Diner at my favorite local coffee shop this Wednesday. Even though we had to wait over an hour in line, it was a fun thing to do in the middle of a very busy week. I&#8217;m just so happy to have a Luke&#8217;s Diner coffee sleeve! And like everyone else, I cannot wait for the new episodes to come out on Netflix next month!</p>
<p>(3) Since we only did two of the three days in ACL weekend 1, we missed a band we wanted to see on Saturday, so we went to their late night show during the week instead. It was a beautiful night, the venue was great, and the show was a lot of fun!</p>
<p>(4) This past weekend I went to Dallas for my high school bestie&#8217;s bachelorette party! We had such a great weekend hanging out at the hotel, doing a Grapevine Wine Tour, and eating great food!</p>

<li>Promotion week at work! My promotion gift from my boss was a Yeti tumbler, and I&#8217;m very impressed with its ability to keep my coffee hot for hours!</li>
<li>A couple of days with the slightest crispness of fall here in Texas &#8211; it will come eventually!</li>
<li>Hours and hours of work</li>
</ul>
