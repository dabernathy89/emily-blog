<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Month series!  In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous month ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have babies, everyday moments are extra special!</p>
<p>July had plenty of lovely memories, but it also brought sadness. My Papa went to be with Jesus on July 18th, just a few months after Mimi. He lived a beautiful life. He packed his last few months full of social activities: Sunday school, family visits, Ellen&#8217;s wedding, Caden&#8217;s birthday party, and more. I wanted to share what I wrote for his service here like I did for Mimi:</p>
<div>
<p>One of my fondest memories of Papa was going with him to his office in Olney a few times. I loved filling up a cup of candy from his Runts dispenser and settling in to observe a small part of his work routine and watch his friendly conversations with his employees and clients. I first became interested in the CPA world because I wanted to be like Papa one day. Once I went on to college and then onto my career as a CPA, Papa would always ask about what I was learning and working on. I&#8217;ve truly enjoyed sharing these conversations with Papa &#8211; not only was he one of the few interested in an accounting career, but I have also always been proud of my similarities with him.</p>
<p>Carson asks about Mimi and Papa a lot. Back when we were preparing to drive to Waco for Mimi&#8217;s funeral, I was telling him about all of the cousins who would be at Terry and Vicki&#8217;s to play with him. He said &#8220;Oh! You forgot Papa!&#8221;.  I had a very similar conversation with him again yesterday, getting him excited for the weekend ahead, and he once again asked about Papa. While he doesn&#8217;t yet understand, I told him Papa is in Heaven with Mimi. Even though he is just 3 years old, I don&#8217;t think he will ever forget some of his Papa memories. My last memory with Papa was taking the kids to the hospital last week to visit. Carson and Caden were both very proud to sing and dance to Wheels on the Bus and ABCs as Papa clapped along.</p>
<p>We love you so much, Papa.</p>

<p>I start these posts with some favorites from the month and then share some photos and highlights after that.</p>
<h2>Favorites from the Month:</h2>
<p><em>{This section contains some Amazon affiliate links.}</em></p>
<p><strong>Fiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/3iviAiW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Things We Cannot Say</a> by Kelly Rimmer. This is a beautiful WWII fiction novel that flips between the life of a young woman during that war and a related woman in modern day trying to learn more about her family&#8217;s past . There are a lot of good WWII fiction books out there, but this is probably my favorite one that I&#8217;ve read. Truly a beautifully-written story.</p>
<p><strong>Nonfiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/3CzQQ4E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">That Sounds Fun: The Joys of Being an Amateur, The Power of Falling in Love, and Why You Need a Hobby</a> by Annie F. Downs. This is a quick read about the importance of seeking out fun in your life. I loved reading about Annie&#8217;s life and enjoyed how it got me thinking about incorporating more fun into the daily routine.</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> &#8211; We&#8217;ve been listening to a lot of <em>Sound of Music</em>, <em>Mary Poppins</em>, and <em>Les Miserables</em> music in our house. Carson loves and requests these songs all day long!</p>
<p><strong>Movie/TV</strong> &#8211; We flew threw the &#8220;Behind Her Eyes&#8221; series on Netflix. Just wow. I did not expect that ending.</p>
<p><strong>Item</strong> &#8211; My EC Hourly planner. It&#8217;s a fun hobby to decorate it, but mostly it keeps me very organized.</p>
<p><strong>Activity</strong> &#8211; Celebrating the life of Papa with our extended family</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishment</strong> &#8211; Continuing with a great Peloton streak. I love my (almost) daily rides!</p>
