<p>It has been such a great weekend. Friday I had a lovely dinner with my friend Kaitlin while Daniel hosted a game night and pizza at our apartment for a couple of friends. Saturday I made it to my favorite yoga/pilates class at the gym, we ate brunch outside at a restaurant in Shirlington we had been dying to try (<a href="http://www.copperwoodtavern.com/" target="_blank">Copperwood Tavern</a> &#8211; yum! Pictured above.), we went to see Divergent in theaters (very good!), and then we spent the rest of the evening at Barnes and Noble planning Paris, reading, and working. Today we will attend church, try to get some things done around the apartment, and go to small group.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Workweek-Anywhere-Expanded/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394387527&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+4+hour+work+week" target="_blank">The 4-Hour Workweek</a> by Timothy Ferriss. Almost done! The author has some really interesting advice. I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;ll give a short review with my Weekly Wishes tomorrow or Tuesday.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>in my planner. Lots of fun things to look forward to post-busy season!</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to the Explosions in the Sky Pandora station &#8211; an old favorite</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I&#8217;m really excited to have discovered my grocery store&#8217;s pick up service.  I can order all of my groceries through an app (in which I can also make lists to automatically add on to future orders), select a pick up time, and then just drive up to the store at my pick up time for someone to bring my bags right to my car. The best part is that this is apparently a totally free service, and they don&#8217;t allow tipping. Too good to be true? We almost always do our big grocery runs on the weekend when it is the most crowded, so this would definitely save us time. Have any of you used a grocery pick-up service? What do you think?</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  my Cranberry Pear Bellini BBW candle</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> I could implement some of the tips that Timothy Ferriss suggests in his book I&#8217;m reading (see &#8220;<em>Reading</em>&#8221; above)</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>for another absolutely gorgeous day like yesterday. It was almost 70 degrees, and I was wearing flip-flops for the first time this year</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>pajamas</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> looking at pictures of my family on Facebook. Some of them participated in the Bearathon yesterday &#8211; a half marathon that Baylor (my alma mater) puts on every year, and I&#8217;ve enjoyed scrolling through those pictures.</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to nail down all of our plans for London and Paris. We have spent some time in Barnes &amp; Noble going through stacks of travel books on both places and making lists of things we want to do, but now we have to narrow the lists down because they are huge. Let me know if any of you have suggestions on things we cannot miss! Also, we will be in Paris for our 3rd anniversary, and we are looking for a great place to eat that won&#8217;t break the bank.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to be productive today<br />

<p><em>Feeling</em>  happy and blessed</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>TripAdvisor sites for London and Paris and, of course, my Bloglovin&#8217; feed<a href="https://twitter.com/siddathornton"><br />

<p>Enjoy your day!</p>
