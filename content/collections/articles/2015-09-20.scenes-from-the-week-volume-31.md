<p>Happy Sunday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. I also link up with <a href="http://siddathornton.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Lauren</a> for The Sunday Currently each week to share snippets from my Sunday afternoon which you&#8217;ll find at the bottom of this post. Since I&#8217;ve been absent from the blog for the past couple of weeks, I wanted to share a few highlights from both this week and last week for this week&#8217;s post.</p>

<p>Clockwise from top left:</p>
<p>(1) Look at those beautiful Texas Friday night lights! Last weekend I drove to Waco to see my brother&#8217;s marching band perform at the half time show of the high school football game. It&#8217;s always fun to go to a high school game, and it was especially a treat to see my brother as a drum major! I&#8217;m so proud of him. It was a great evening spent with family.</p>
<p>(2) Before heading back home from Waco, I stopped by my cousin&#8217;s new house and took some pictures with this cutie pie!</p>
<p>(3) Easy Tiger here in Austin has a bake shop with delicious pastries and coffee. We stopped by this morning before church.</p>
<p>(4) Thursday night we drove to Dallas to spend time with my sister Ellen. Friday night we all went over to my great aunt&#8217;s home to have dinner and play ping-pong!</p>
<p><em>Not pictured:</em></p>
<p>We had lots of family time this weekend. As mentioned above, we visited my great aunt Friday night. Saturday night we went out to my grandparents&#8217; house for a birthday party for my grandma and great aunt. My cousin and aunt also came to the party, so it was a fun family-filled weekend!</p>
<h4><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></h4>
<p><em>Reading </em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Martian-Novel-Andy-Weir-ebook/dp/B00EMXBDMA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442786757&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+martian+book" target="_blank">The Martian</a>. I want to finish this one before the movie comes out in two weeks! Have any of you read it? I&#8217;ve heard nothing but good things!</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>a to-do list so that I can take full advantage of my day off tomorrow. I&#8217;m thinking a great mix of relaxation and productivity.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to Mates of State on Pandora</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>about how we are entering my favorite time of the year &#8211; October, November, December &#8211; I love it all!</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> coffee, of course</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to get back into my outside-of-work activities this week: pilates, blogging, Project Life, reading, cooking, etc&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>jeans and a t-shirt</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>seeing so many family members this weekend. It is such a privilege to live in the same state as so many members of the family. Seeing them is as easy as hopping in the car and taking a drive (which was not an option when we lived in DC).</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>dinner. What will it be tonight? Maybe the restaurant next door&#8230;. We should probably eat something healthy though after a weekend of bad (yet delicious!) food!</p>
<p><em>Watching  </em>fall TV premieres! Well, not yet, but I will be later this week. I&#8217;m especially looking forward to Nashville, Scandal, and Grey&#8217;s Anatomy!</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to enjoy the present moment rather than always looking forward to the future. Planning and dreaming is great, but I want to embrace the here and now.</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>relieved to be done with our major fall deadline at work</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>through lots and lots of blogs</p>
