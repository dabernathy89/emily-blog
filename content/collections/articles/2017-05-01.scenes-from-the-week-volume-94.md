<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>(1) I took some time off work this week, and my mom came to visit. We had a really nice day together and ended the day walking by the river at sunset.</p>
<p>(2) A new grilled cheese food truck recently opened up next door to us. I swung by for lunch during a work-from-home day earlier this week. The grilled cheeses there are DELICIOUS!</p>
<p>(3) We had a really low-key weekend, but we got out Saturday evening to try a new-to-us Mexican restaurant, Grizzelda&#8217;s. It was really yummy. Their chips and queso may be my favorite in Austin!</p>
<p>(4) <a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2015/07/lazy-days-with-banana-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banana</a> was being extra cuddly this week! I had to snap a photo of him snuggling up to Daniel Saturday night.</p>

<li>I shared one of the major highlights from our Europe backpacking trip, <a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2017/04/travel-with-me-five-days-in-lake-como/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our five days of relaxation in Lake Como</a>, Italy! I posted an overload of photos, but it was one of the most picturesque places I&#8217;ve ever visited, so I couldn&#8217;t help myself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
