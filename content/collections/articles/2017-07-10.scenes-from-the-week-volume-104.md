<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

It&#8217;s hard to believe that we are now in July. I often consider July and August to be my least favorite months of the year (because of the heat), but I&#8217;m determined to enjoy them this year and live them to the fullest. We have several fun things coming up, so that will make it even easier to savor these hot months! This weekend we got off to a great start by going to Waco for one night to do the Waco Escape Room for a belated Fathers&#8217; Day celebration! All three of us sisters and my brother were there in addition to my husband and both Ellen and Elizabeth&#8217;s boyfriends. We joked that my brother Ben was the ninth wheel, but he didn&#8217;t seem to mind. 🙂 Saturday Ellen and her boyfriend Lane stayed with us after going to a wedding in Austin, and we had a great time together.</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Banana was having none of it when we starting packing for our overnight trip. I never would have thought a cat could sense things like this, but I swear he knows when we are packing for a trip. He starts acting very differently from any other time and gets all sad. 🙁</p>
<p>(2) At the Waco Escape Room, we made the leader board! In our particular room, we made third place of all time with a time of 33 minutes, 27 seconds. Our room&#8217;s theme was a serial killer, and I was amazed at all the detail involved in the game. We had a great time as a family, and most importantly, my dad had a lot of fun! Happy Belated Fathers&#8217; Day, Dad! We love you!</p>
<p>(3) Back in Austin on Saturday, Ellen and Lane wanted BBQ after the wedding, so we headed over to Terry Black&#8217;s. We are convinced they have upped their game since making the Texas Monthly Top 50 List because it was incredible. It definitely felt worth the half hour wait in line.</p>
<p>(4) Sunday morning we all headed over to Barton Springs Pool! Even though we live just around the corner from it, I&#8217;m embarrassed to say this was our first time taking a dip. It was a fun experience, even though it was freezing cold water! It&#8217;s very refreshing, and I can&#8217;t wait to go back after our next morning of hiking.</p>

<li>Going to see <em>The Big Sick</em>.  Kumail Nanjiani did an amazing job playing himself and sharing his story. Ray Romano was definitely a favorite actor in the movie as well. The movie will have you laughing and crying, and it will remind you to love and appreciate those closest to you. Go see it!</li>
<li>Eating our favorite pizza at Via 313 on Sunday after church. Ellen and I both got some refreshing rosé aperol spritz&#8217;s with our lunch, and it was the perfect summer drink!</li>
