<p><strong>Playing</strong> | Pandora over and over and over&#8230;. My favorite stations are Explosions in the Sky, Nashville, and Taylor Swift.</p>
<p><strong>Going</strong> |<i> </i>Not many places over the next few weeks. It is going to be so nice to stay at home in Austin for a little bit! But we have some trips planned to visit family, and we also have some great international trips coming up later this year (I posted about them <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2015/01/2015-travel-wishlist/" target="_blank">here</a>)!</p>
<p><b>Wearing </b>| Cotton shorts and a t-shirt &#8211; my usual outfit on a weeknight at home</p>
<p><strong>Sipping</strong> | Some hot tea. I&#8217;ve really been enjoying drinking hot tea most evenings even though it&#8217;s getting hot outside. Does anyone have some tea suggestions? I love the tea aisle at the grocery store &#8211; so many fun flavors to choose from!</p>
<p><strong>Reading</strong> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Nightingale-Kristin-Hannah/dp/0312577222" target="_blank">The Nightingale</a> by Kristin Hannah</p>
<p><strong>Listening</strong> | To the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outlander-Diana-Gabaldon/dp/0440212561" target="_blank">Outlander</a> audio book still! Only listening 15 minutes per day makes for slow progress&#8230;. I think I&#8217;m almost done though.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking</strong> | Much more these days after taking a long break. Lately, we have been pretty good about meal planning. We made some delicious Veggie-Stuffed Peppers last week!</p>
<p><strong>Drinking</strong> | Lots of La Croix water these days. I haven&#8217;t had soda for a year and a half, so I enjoy getting to taste the carbonation after being off of it for so long.</p>
