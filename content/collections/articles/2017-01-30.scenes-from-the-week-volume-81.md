<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>(1) Daniel stayed up until 2am on Wednesday night putting together our new guest bed from Ikea. We actually tried to avoid shopping for Ikea furniture this time around like we&#8217;ve always done, but Ikea is the only place we could find the exact type of bed we wanted. Our guest room is tiny and also acts as Daniel&#8217;s office everyday (he works from home), so we didn&#8217;t want to fill it up with a king- or queen-sized bed that takes up most of the space. We wanted a bed that takes up the space of a twin and turns into a king when we have guests, but we were not interested in a trundle bed. While I don&#8217;t love the style of the bed we got, it does exactly what we wanted. Once it was built, I grew to like it even more! It has drawer space underneath, and to turn it into a king bed, all you have to do is pull out the bottom and move the top mattress (that&#8217;s currently sitting on top of the bottom mattress) onto the part you pulled out. We love it! I picked this flat gray bedding for the twin size, but we have a cozy white duvet for the king size.</p>
<p>(2) The biggest event of the week was Daniel&#8217;s surgery on Friday to get his gallbladder removed. We arrived at 5am on Friday, and all seemed to be going well. But right after I took this picture, something scary happened. Daniel hates needles, so whenever the nurse put in his IV, he started to feel really light-headed. The nurse stepped out for a minute, and I heard Daniel say &#8220;Woah!&#8221; and then make a strange noise. I walked over to him, and he began shaking like he was having a seizure. Of course, I yelled for help, and eight or nine nurses ran in to help. It ends up that he had passed out from a very low heart heart, and apparently seizure-like symptoms can happen sometimes when a person passes out (I had no idea!). He is fine, but they wanted him to get checked out by the cardiologist and run some tests, so we ended up waiting in the hospital for a long time. His surgery went well, and we did basically nothing the whole weekend while he healed up.</p>
<p>(3) We barely left the apartment this weekend. See (2) above. I did a whole lot of cleaning and reading which was really nice. I&#8217;m absolutely loving Rachel Held Evan&#8217;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2kIv1eR" target="_blank">Searching for Sunday</a>.</p>
<p>(4) Banana took a cue from his parents and enjoyed a lazy Sunday as well. 🙂</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>A weeknight coffee date to catch up with Kaelin and Andres. It gets hard to keep up with friends whenever you are on Whole30, so we made it happen at a coffee shop!</li>
<li>Starting to watch Downton Abbey for the first time. I&#8217;m only two episodes in, but I can tell I&#8217;m going to love it.</li>
<li>Finally putting together our Austria + Germany 2015 photo book on <a href="https://www.artifactuprising.com/" target="_blank">Artifact Uprising</a>. Next, I&#8217;m going to put together a big book for our Europe backpacking trip. I want this one to be nice and probably hardcover. Artifact Uprising has some good options, but I wanted to ask here if anyone has recommendations for other photo book websites and explore my options.</li>
<li>We started a Monday night class with our church about missions. It&#8217;s a ten-week class which is a big commitment, but I think we will really enjoy going.</li>
</ul>

<li>I shared a <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2017/01/travel-with-me-a-guide-to-bern-switzerland/" target="_blank">travel guide to Bern, Switzerland</a>, an amazing Swiss city that I hope everyone can visit!</li>
