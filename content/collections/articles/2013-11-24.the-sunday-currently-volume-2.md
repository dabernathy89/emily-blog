<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading</em>  my <a href="http://shereadstruth.com/2013/11/20/givethanksday3/" target="_blank">She Reads Truth study</a> and still working on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-100-Startup-Reinvent-Living/dp/0307951529" target="_blank">The $100 Startup</a> by Chris Guillebeau</p>
<p><em>Writing</em>  a Target shopping list for this afternoon. We have quite the list since we are making several things for Thanksgiving with Daniel&#8217;s family next week!</p>
<p><em>Listening </em> to the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/A-December-Remember-Dave-Barnes/dp/B00G0DOPKW/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385302795&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=dave+barnes+christmas" target="_blank">Dave Barnes Christmas album</a>. I love him.</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I have to get off this couch in ten minutes if I&#8217;m going to go to this BodyPump class this afternoon</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  my morning coffee and my Marshmallow Fireside candle from BBW</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> for more snow! It snowed a teeny bit last night as we were leaving our Friendsgiving.</p>
<p><em>Hoping </em> that I can get most things ready for our road trip this afternoon. We are driving about 11-12 hours to Nashville to stay in a cabin that Daniel&#8217;s family rented. We start our drive Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p><em>Wearing </em> an old Lions Club basketball t-shirt (from 4th grade ha), pajama pants, and cozy Christmas socks</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> that I woke up at a decent hour this morning and lots I&#8217;m kidding lots of cuddles with my kitty this morning (see picture above)</p>
<p><em>Wanting </em> to purchase some more fun Christmas decorations. Maybe I&#8217;ll find some bargains at Target this afternoon?</p>
<p><em>Needing</em>  a thicker blanket. It&#8217;s cold in here!</p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  very much in the holiday mood. I&#8217;m so happy we are in my favorite time of year!</p>
<p><em>Clicking</em>  Bloglovin&#8217; and my Netflix DVD queue (moving Christmas movies to the top of the list for watching after Thanksgiving!)<a href="https://twitter.com/siddathornton"><br />

<p>I really enjoyed that again! I&#8217;m looking forward to reading everyone else&#8217;s TSCs. Happy Thanksgiving Week!</p>
