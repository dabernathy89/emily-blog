<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Month series!  In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous month ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have babies, everyday moments are extra special!</p>
<h2>Favorites from the Month:</h2>
<p><em>{This section contains some Amazon affiliate links.}</em></p>
<p><strong>Fiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/2QJZ3Au" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Heir Affair</a> by Heather Cocks. This is the second book in <em>The Royal We</em> series. It was good, but I found the beginning and middle to be very slow. The ending made up for it so I finished it feeling like it was a solid fiction read. It&#8217;s been a long time since I read the first book in <em>The Royal We</em> series, but I remember LOVING that one, so the slow start for this one was a little disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>Nonfiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/3eSjXW4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing</a> by Daniel Pink. This was the only nonfiction book I read this month, so it kind of lands in this spot by default. It was interesting but dry, and I didn&#8217;t take too much personal application from it.</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> &#8211; I enjoyed <a href="https://amzn.to/3gWORPJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taylor&#8217;s Version of Fearless</a> (major throwback) that she just released as well as some other old favorites, like Jars of Clay&#8217;s <a href="https://amzn.to/3aUWUbS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inland</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Movie/TV</strong> &#8211; Well, I really loved the <em>Firefly Lane</em> series on Netflix (just as much as I loved the book when I read it years and years ago). I was going to say that was my favorite show, but then <em>Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</em> dropped three new episodes on Hulu that were jaw-dropping, so I guess that show takes the cake!</p>
<p><strong>Item</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;ve really been enjoying my Kindle and borrowing eBooks from the library.</p>
<p><strong>Activity</strong> &#8211; Celebrating both boys&#8217; birthdays!</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishment</strong> &#8211; Getting the second COVID vaccine and surviving having a horrible stomach virus at the same time as the whole rest of the family (I wouldn&#8217;t wish that on anybody!)</p>
<p>April was a month of celebrating our boys! Caden turned 1 on the 6th, and Carson turned 3 on the 24th! We also celebrated the life of Daniel&#8217;s Grandma in St. Petersburg, FL, who went to be with Jesus on Easter morning.</p>

He&#8217;s up to four seconds under water, and he loves his teacher Mr. Ryan!</p>
<p>(2) Daniel and his boys at the playground 🙂</p>
<p>(3) This was outside of Easter brunch. How cute are these brothers all dressed up for Easter?! We had a fun egg hunt at home and also opened Easter baskets after nap time.</p>
<p>(4) I took Caden for his one year appointment at the pediatrician. This was our first visit after the tragic loss of our own pediatrician Dr. Dodson. This sign was set up outside of their temporary location. We truly do miss and love Dr. Dodson.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SFTM_April-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_2.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11961" src="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SFTM_April-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_2.png" alt="SFTM_April 2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com" width="940" height="788" srcset="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SFTM_April-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_2.png 940w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SFTM_April-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_2-300x251.png 300w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SFTM_April-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_2-768x644.png 768w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SFTM_April-2021_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_2-640x537.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" />(</a>1) On Caden&#8217;s actual birthday, Daniel took the day off, and we all went to Little Land Play Gym. The boys LOVED this place. They were especially drawn to this giant light-up pegboard.</p>
<p>(2) My baby is one! We&#8217;ve made it through a lot this year together, so there was much to celebrate.</p>
<p>(3) Soaking in all the little moments with my one-year-old!</p>
<p>(4) Unfortunately, later that week, we all got a horrible stomach bug. It started with Carson (who we actually took to the emergency room in the middle of the night), then Daniel, then me, then Caden. This is Caden sleeping in our bed so we could help him when he got sick. 🙁 We had to postpone the family party we had planned for him to the first weekend of May.</p>

He&#8217;s needed one for a long time. When he was about four months, he went bald on the sides and back of his head, but he kept a little &#8220;mohawk&#8221; in the top middle, which grew into long hair over his eyes by the time he was 10 months! He was very overdue for a trim. He had a lot of fun getting his hair cut. This is a &#8220;before&#8221; pic.</p>
<p>(2) And this is Caden after the haircut! All smiles!</p>
<p>(3) As I mentioned earlier, Daniel and I went to St. Pete, FL for his grandmother&#8217;s memorial service. It was wonderful to get together with family and share all of the wonderful, funny stories about her.</p>
<p>(4) Caden can CLIMB almost anything he can reach now, including the bathroom stool. I definitely have my hands full!</p>

We had so so much fun. We enjoyed the wave pool&#8230;</p>
<p>(2) &#8230;the water swings&#8230;</p>
<p>(3) ..the outdoor pool areas&#8230;</p>
<p>(4)&#8230; and especially the slides for kids! We had a little family party in our hotel room Saturday and celebrated as much as we could in the middle of all the playing and splashing!</p>
<p>Have a great May! I just love May and look forward to looking back on the memories we will make this month.</p>
