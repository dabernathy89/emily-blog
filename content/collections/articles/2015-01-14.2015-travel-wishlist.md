It&#8217;s no secret on this blog that my husband Daniel and I absolutely love to travel both domestically and internationally. We did a lot of domestic traveling last year along with a trip over to <a title="Travel with Me // London – What We Did" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/06/travel-with-me-london-what-we-did/" target="_blank">London and Paris in May</a>. We have made travel a priority in our lives, and I hope that we will always be able to do that.</p>

<p>In preparation for this year, we have been saving lots and lots of frequent flyer miles and hotel points in order to make our 2015 travel wish list become a reality. I&#8217;m happy to say that I think we will be able to make it happen! Here is our dream travel plan for 2015:</p>
<h2>May</h2>
<h3>Las Vegas</h3>
<p>Daniel is attending a conference there in May, and I hope to tag along! I have never been. Honestly, I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m going to love it, but I feel like I need to visit at least once!</p>
<h2>July</h2>
<h3>Peru</h3>
<p>My aunt and uncle live in Lima, so we want to spend time with them for a few days and then head over to Machu Picchu. I&#8217;ve been to Peru for a summer mission trip before and have actually spent quite some time in various parts of South America, but Daniel has never been to South America. I can&#8217;t wait for him to experience it.</p>
<h2>November</h2>
<h3>Germany &amp; Austria</h3>
<p>Our flights are actually already booked for this one because we found an incredible award redemption price for it. I cannot wait to explore the Christmas markets and experience an area of the world I have never been!</p>
<h2>December</h2>
<h3>London</h3>
<p>My family will be traveling to London after Christmas to see my brother&#8217;s marching band in a parade. Daniel and I really hope to join them for this experience!</p>
<p>Those are our plans! I know it is a bit ambitious, but as I said, I think we can swing it with our points and miles. We actually hope to add in a couple of weekend trips to visit friends in different states and explore other towns in Texas as well, but we will plan those as they come throughout the year.</p>
<p>Do you have any fun trips planned for 2015?</p>
