<p>After nearly four months of constant travel, I am happy to say we are home in Austin! I have loved every minute of our travels (starting with our Christmas markets trip to Austria and Germany at the end of November and then traveling around more of <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/tag/abernathy-adventure/" target="_blank">Western Europe for 2.5 months</a> after spending Christmas with family). But I&#8217;ve always cherished the feeling of coming home to the familiar, and it has been a long time on the road!</p>
<p>Over the next couple of weeks before I return to the office, I&#8217;m going to attempt to get my life back on track, and that includes getting back to regular posting on the blog! I&#8217;m starting to get more inspired this morning, so I figured it was a good day to start regularly posting. In addition to a ton of travel content coming your way as I catch up on our big trip recaps, I&#8217;ve decided to also bring back my Scenes From the Week series. Here we go!</p>

<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>
<p>(1) After starting the week off with a fabulous four days in Rome (recap to come in the future!), it was time to go home. During one of our layovers, I caught this beautiful moment of sunshine and pouring rain at the same time.</p>
<p>(2) One major problem with living in Austin is that we cannot convince ourselves to eat healthy once returning home from a trip. There are too many delicious things that we craved while we were gone! We made Shake Shack across the street one of our first stops and didn&#8217;t hold back &#8211; we ordered burgers, fries, and dessert&#8230;. It was just as delicious as it looks.</p>
<p>(3) My #1 craving while we were gone was a delicious bowl of queso, and I satisfied that craving with a bowl from one of our favorite local Tex-Mex places, Hula Hut!</p>
<p>(4) And, of course, we&#8217;ve already hit up several of our favorite coffee places. Summer Moon makes the best lattes with their secret Moon Milk!</p>

<li>Ice cream from Lick</li>
<li>Visit with good friends and Indian food at The Clay Pit</li>
<li>Visit with good friends in town for SXSW and brunch at Kerbey Lane</li>
<li>Afternoon trip to Fredericksburg and the surrounding Hill Country, including a stop at Pieous for Neopolitan pizza (which, I must say, is very close to the real thing from Naples!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week, and a very Happy Easter!</p>
