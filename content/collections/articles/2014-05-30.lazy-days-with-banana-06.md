<p>Ever since we got back from Europe, Banana has insisted on trying to get our attention every second we are home. If we are up walking around, he follows us &#8211; &#8220;meow meow meow&#8221; &#8211; until we sit down. When we close the door at night (we typically try to make the bedroom a furr-free zone by not letting him in), he cries like a baby and scratches on the door and sticks his paws under the door for hours  &#8211; one time it was ALL NIGHT LONG. This is not normal for him. He obviously missed us while we were gone and is trying to make up for lost time. It is driving us crazy!!</p>
<p>But, when we are sitting down, he is as content as ever to snuggle or just watch us as we do whatever we are doing &#8211; as long as we are not up moving around or behind closed doors where he can&#8217;t see us. I know that he will start calming down soon once he realizes we are actually staying home (for now). Meanwhile, I try to remind myself that he is only doing this because he loves us and wants to spend time with us so badly, which is pretty cute.  I really do love my chubby kitty!</p>
