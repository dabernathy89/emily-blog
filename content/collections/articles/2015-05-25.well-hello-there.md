<p>I have not posted on this blog for over three months now. Whenever I started writing this blog at the end of 2013, I had hoped to commit to at least somewhat of a consistent posting schedule until I decided to stop blogging altogether.  However, due to an insane work schedule in my new office here in Austin, I had to stop for a while. I didn&#8217;t just stop writing on my blog &#8211; I stopped participating in the blogging community altogether. I read very few blogs, only commented once or twice, and my participation in the blogging Facebook groups I&#8217;m in was non-existent.</p>
<p>Today is the last day of a four day weekend for me.  It has been a glorious weekend of quality time with my husband, good food, TV watching, and a teeny bit of sun and pool time. Despite the never-ending rain here in Texas, it has a been a good time to relax and recharge. So now that I&#8217;m rested and getting back into somewhat of a routine, I think I&#8217;m ready to start getting back into blogging. To be honest, I&#8217;m hesitant to start again because I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll have to stop again. But, I&#8217;ve convinced myself that that doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; I should write here when I can and not be hard on myself when I need to take a break.</p>
<p>To anyone who is still out there, hello! I&#8217;m glad to be back.</p>
