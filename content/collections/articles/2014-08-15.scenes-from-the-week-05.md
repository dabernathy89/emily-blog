<p><span style="color: #222222;"> </span><span id=":179" dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;">Happy Friday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts I share the highlights from my week &#8211; from memorable events to the small things that made me smile.</span> Here is a glimpse into this past week:</p>
<h1>Monday</h1>
<p>On my way home from work, I stopped at Trader Joe&#8217;s to pick up a bunch of groceries &#8211; mostly food for lunches to pack for work and frozen dinners for Daniel to eat since I was going to be eating dinner at the office the majority of the week. While taking a peek at the frozen dessert section, something amazing caught my eye. Speculoos Cookie Butter Ice Cream!! I love Trader Joe&#8217;s Speculoos cookies (just think cinnamon cookies that go really well with coffee), and their Cookie Butter is awesome, AND I love vanilla ice cream mixed with cookies (but not anything chocolate &#8211; I don&#8217;t like chocolate). So this was a match made in heaven. Daniel and I had planned on having a healthy week, but that pretty much went down the drain the second I brought this home. It&#8217;s gone now, and we are going to resist buying it for at least a few weeks, but I highly recommend it!</p>

<p>Monday was also the tragic day that Robin Williams passed away. It was nice to have ice cream to cheer us up that evening.</p>
<h1>Tuesday</h1>
<p>It poured all day long. I actually love the rain when I&#8217;m not stuck getting drenched in it &#8211; for some reason, it makes me more productive to know it&#8217;s raining outside.</p>
<p>For lunch I met my friend Catherine at Pho Deluxe. I had never had pho before, and I loved it! It is a <span style="color: #222222;">Vietnamese beef and noodle soup which was perfect for a rainy day. I&#8217;m looking forward to going with Daniel so that he can give pho a try.</span></p>
<h1>Wednesday</h1>
<p>At work I decided to listen to all of my music on my iPhone on shuffle mode. I like to do that sometimes to remind myself of the music that I have and love and often forget about.</p>
<p>That evening I was home for dinner, so we heated up some Trader Joe&#8217;s turkey corn dogs. While we ate, we watched an episode of Suits, one of our favorite shows of the summer.</p>
<h1>Thursday</h1>
<p>In the evening we drove over to Buzz  Bakery (one of our favorite local coffee shops) to work. I did some blogging and blog reading and a little trip planning (I can&#8217;t stop!). While we were there, Daniel ordered their pimiento grilled cheese for dinner. I had a little bite, and we decided that we are going to come here just for grilled cheeses sometime because it was so good!</p>
