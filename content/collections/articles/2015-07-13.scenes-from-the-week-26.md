<p>Happy Monday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these quick posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>(1) Wednesday I went over to my sister&#8217;s new apartment for dinner with her and some of her friends. On the way over, we stopped at Whole Foods for some delicious desserts to bring over. I&#8217;m amazed at Whole Foods&#8217; options for tasty treats! We walked away with a couple of boxes of cute mini desserts.</p>
<p>(2) Awhile back, Christine over at <a href="http://www.cestchristine.com/" target="_blank">C&#8217;est Christine</a> posted about <a href="http://www.cestchristine.com/2015/05/a-weekend-in-texas/" target="_blank">her trip to Austin</a>. She mentioned that Blenders and Bowls was one of her favorite places she ate. Last week, I discovered that this little cafe is one block away from my office! I went there for lunch twice last week &#8211; it&#8217;s absolutely delicious! So far, I&#8217;ve just gotten the Beach Bowl, an acai bowl with mango, strawberries, granola, honey, blueberries, and coconut shavings.</p>
<p>(3) On Friday, my parents came to Austin and brought along a family member from Brazil. Jana has never been to the United States before this visit. It was so great to meet her and to hear about her life. We took her to Hopdoddy&#8217;s (a popular gourmet burger joint) for dinner and spent some time at my sister&#8217;s hanging out.</p>
<p>(4) This weekend was full of fun visitors. One of them was a college friend of ours. We had a fun weekend, but the highlight of his visit for me was a trip to the mini golf course down the street from us. It was blazing hot, but it was fun to play a round of putt-putt. I hadn&#8217;t played in years!</p>

<li>Saturday we met another college friend and her boyfriend for brunch. I hadn&#8217;t seen Elisha for two years! It was so great to catch up over coffee and delicious brunch dishes.</li>
<li>Later on Saturday I got a text from one of my best friends from high school saying that she was also in town and wanted to meet up! We were only able to meet for a quick visit at our apartment, but it was a good one. 🙂</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve been going strong with my Blogilates Beginner&#8217;s 2.0 Calendar this week, and I&#8217;m loving it. I&#8217;ll do a full review once I get through the end of this calendar.</li>
<li>My addiction to Summermoon Coffee Bar&#8217;s Half Wintermoon Lattes is getting worse.</li>
<li>Sunday evenings spent at the pool with Daniel and a good book are a new favorite of mine!</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Monday! Have a great week!</p>
