<p>I&#8217;m writing this post from home for what seems like the first time in ages! We have been traveling up a storm, taking advantage of the sweet summertime. It has been amazing, but sometimes an unplanned weekend at home is the best. Friday Daniel and I checked out Truckeroo, one of DC&#8217;s food truck festivals (yummy!) and then called it a very early night. Saturday was filled with meal planning, running errands, a matinee (we saw Begin Again and really enjoyed it!), and a night out with friends. For today, we are going to go out for a late lunch, and then I hope to get to some cleaning and reading. Also, today is finally the day where I begin the process of upgrading my blog to wordpress.org with a new design and all! I&#8217;ve never done this before, but this could mean my blog looks different as soon as this evening. We will see!</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em> Mindy Kaling&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everyone-Hanging-Without-Other-Concerns/dp/0307886271" target="_blank">Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns)</a>. I haven&#8217;t actually started, but I&#8217;m looking forward to it! I hear it&#8217;s a fun, light read.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>plans in my planner and blog post ideas. Also, I&#8217;ve gotten back into my wonderful habit of daily journaling. Okay, I haven&#8217;t quite gotten back to doing it every single day, but I am writing in it several times a week, and it feels so good!</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to a summer playlist I made for myself. Currently, One Minute More by Capital Cities is playing. I just love this song!</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that it&#8217;s certainly time for some lunch</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> my Caribbean Escape candle</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to get back into my old workout routine this week. For real this time&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>shorts and a v-neck t-shirt</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> coffee. And my summer playlist. And snuggling with my kitty (meet <a title="Lazy Days with Banana // 01" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2013/11/14/lazy-days-with-banana-1/" target="_blank">Banana</a> here).</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>some sort of egg dish for lunch. Usually for Sunday lunch/brunch, I want nothing more than a stack of pancakes, but today I&#8217;m really craving eggs&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to get over to my apartment complex&#8217;s pool soon! Every summer, I look back and wonder why I didn&#8217;t spend more time by the pool here.</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>kind of headachey but fairly good otherwise</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>on Bloglovin&#8217;. Just this morning I discovered two new blogs that I love, so I&#8217;m enjoying clicking through their posts (<a href="http://www.bookwormsindresses.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.herlibraryadventures.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
