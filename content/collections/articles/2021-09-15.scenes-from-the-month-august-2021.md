<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Month series!  In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous month ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have babies, everyday moments are extra special!</p>
<div>
<p>August was pretty low-key. We had a trip to DC planned, but it was postponed to the end of September. So, we mostly stayed home, enjoyed family time, and did a quick trip to East Texas.</p>
<p>I start these posts with some favorites from the month and then share some photos and highlights after that.</p>
<h2>Favorites from the Month:</h2>
<p><em>{This section contains some Amazon affiliate links.}</em></p>
<p><strong>Fiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/3AhXTOd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People We Meet on Vacation</a> by Emily Henry. I really enjoyed this book &#8211; there were parts I didn&#8217;t like and the characters annoyed me half the time, but I enjoyed their story and the way their travel changed the setting throughout the book.</p>
<p><strong>Nonfiction Book</strong> &#8211; None this month! I have been really enjoying fiction lately.</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> &#8211; I haven&#8217;t listened to much music this month. Do you have any good music recommendations? Pandora channels, Spotify playlists, new albums, etc?</p>
<p><strong>Movie/TV</strong> &#8211; <em>The Missing</em> on Amazon Prime. How have we never heard of this show before? It is so good &#8211; very similar to my favorite mystery show of all time,<em>The Killing </em>on Netflix.</p>
<p><strong>Item</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://oliveandjune.com/products/the-mani-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olive &amp; June manicure kit</a>. I&#8217;ve been a life-long nail biter, but I stop whenever my nails are painted. Going to get my nails done regularly is not in our budget, so I decided to purchase this manicure kit to try to do my nails regularly at home. Usually my nails are a mess when I try to paint my own, but the tools in this kit along with their tips have really helped me to do a much better at-home manicure.</p>
<p><strong>Activity</strong> &#8211; Visiting my grandparents in East Texas and getting to see my parents, sister, brother-in-law, and brother there.</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishment</strong> &#8211; Pushing through some difficult health days.</p>

Carson&#8217;s hair is wavy, so I&#8217;ve always left it long because I liked that look at him. Caden&#8217;s hair is stick straight, but because I was used to Carson&#8217;s being long, I just kept Caden&#8217;s long out of habit. But I realized both their hair was always in their face, so I decided to let the hair stylist use the trimmers. Caden&#8217;s haircut was much shorter than Carson&#8217;s, and it suddenly transformed him from a baby to a big toddler. I definitely shed tears, but I do think he looks super cute. 🙂</p>
<p>(3) My mom and dad took the boys for a weekend, and they took another fun trip to Sea World!</p>
<p>(4) A daddy and his youngest&#8230; 🙂</p>

It&#8217;s Christmas year-round at their house, so Carson and Caden both got to play with the Christmas train!</p>
<p>(2) They also enjoyed playing basketball with their great-grandpa in the driveway and exploring their old sewing shop.</p>
<p>(3) My mother- and father-in-law came for a visit one weekend, and we really enjoyed the family time.</p>
<p>(4) While they were here, Daniel and Carson snuck away for a very full day at the Kalahari Resort waterpark! We had gone here previously for Carson&#8217;s birthday this past April, and he couldn&#8217;t stop talking about it all summer. So, Daniel surprised him with a day in his favorite place!</p>

<p>(2) Caden wants to be <a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2015/07/lazy-days-with-banana-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Banana&#8217;s</a> best friend so badly, but we are working on learning how to be gentle and that it&#8217;s not a friendly thing to pull his tail, ha!</p>
<p>(3) Carson has put his face to the ground to watch wheels on toy vehicles since before he was one. I love that he still does this as a 3.5 year old.</p>
<p>(4) On our trip back home from East Texas, we stopped at Baylor&#8217;s campus to walk around. Here are the boys checking out the spot where Daniel proposed to me 11 years ago!</p>
<p>Have a fabulous September. I decided that autumn starts on September 1st here, so it&#8217;s officially the start of my favorite months of the year!</p>
