<p>Some of my favorite types of blog posts to read are weekend recaps and &#8220;currently&#8221; posts. I am inspired by hearing about how other people live their daily lives. To join in on the fun, I&#8217;m going to start linking up with <a href="http://siddathornton.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">siddathornton</a> with The Sunday Currently posts. My blog is in its baby stages, so I&#8217;m still seeking out my blog niche and purpose, but I think this series will be an enjoyable way to begin to meet others in the blog community. It will be fun to see if I can provide a little inspiration to other people as my blog grows. So, with that, here we go!!</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading</em> other blog posts and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-100-Startup-Reinvent-Living/dp/0307951529" target="_blank">The $100 Startup</a> by Chris Guillebeau</p>
<p><em>Writing</em> Christmas gift ideas for friends and family and blog content for the week</p>
<p><em>Listening</em> to coffee shop sounds and a Christmas Pandora station (shhh&#8230; don&#8217;t judge!)</p>
<p><em style="line-height:1.5;">Thinking </em>that<em style="line-height:1.5;"> </em>I&#8217;m thrilled I&#8217;ve finally started to write blog posts and am participating in the blog community. It&#8217;s about time! Especially since I have been a blog lurker for over two years<span style="line-height:1.5;"><br />
</span><br />
<em>Smelling</em> coffee and pastries in the local coffee shop I&#8217;m working at this afternoon</p>
<p><em>Wishing</em> I had made it to that 10am BodyPump class at the gym today. Now I have to drag myself over to the 4:30pm class in a little bit when I really just want to take a nap</p>
<p><em>Hoping</em> that I can keep up with my new blogging schedule as well as my workout routine this week. It has been tough to keep up any type of routine with the traveling I&#8217;ve been doing lately.</p>
<p><em>Wearing</em> my favorite GAP jeans, a long sleeve Baylor t-shirt, cozy scarf, and Sperrys</p>
<p><em>Loving</em> spending time with my husband on a relaxing Sunday afternoon in a coffee shop</p>
<p><em>Wanting</em> to see my family. Since we currently live in the DC area, and our families live in Texas, that doesn&#8217;t get to happen nearly enough.</p>
<p><em>Needing</em> to cross more things off my weekend to-do list than I will be able to do.</p>
<p><em>Feeling</em> very tired. I&#8217;ve been staying up way too late for the past three nights. Looking forward to some early nights in for the next few evenings.</p>
<p><em>Clicking</em> Amazon (for creating a wish list and planning out Christmas gift purchases for others), Instagram, and Bloglovin&#8217;. <a href="https://twitter.com/siddathornton"><br />
</a></p>
<p>That was fun! I&#8217;m looking forward to doing this each week.</p>
