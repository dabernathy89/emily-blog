<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

Not only did we get to see family and friends, but also my birthday was Friday and our five year anniversary was Sunday!</p>
<p>(1) My dad was in town for a conference, so we had him over for dinner and a game Tuesday evening. We had a great time eating crockpot BBQ chicken tacos and playing Ticket to Ride.</p>
<p>(2) Friday we went to a restaurant here in Austin called Lenoir that we had been saving for a special occasion. The restaurant is beautiful, and the food was delicious!</p>
<p>(3) Saturday we went to the Hill Country and visited a winery. They were having a special event that included a BBQ food truck and live music. It was a beautiful day in the Hill Country while it was pouring in Austin. I&#8217;m not sure how we got so lucky!</p>
<p>(4) On our anniversary we went to brunch at Josephine House (which is basically the cutest restaurant I&#8217;ve ever seen). This picture of the flowers in the front is just a little snippet of how tasteful this place is. Also, I ate the best pancakes I&#8217;ve ever had (think lemon ricotta and melt-in-your-mouth). We will definitely be back.</p>

<li>We got to spend time with a good friend from DC who was here visiting with a group of her friends.</li>
<li>After dinner on Friday, we met up with friends to continue the celebration!</li>
<li>We had our anniversary dinner at Launderette, a former laundromat-turned gourmet restaurant. It was (hands-down) fantastic! Of course, we ended with dessert. I had the birthday cake ice cream sandwich, and it was divine.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Blog:</p>

<li>I shared our day trip driving the <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2016/05/travel-with-me-an-ireland-road-trip-ring-of-kerry/" target="_blank">Ring of Kerry</a> during our Irish road trip. It was a beautiful day despite the cold and rainy weather.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
