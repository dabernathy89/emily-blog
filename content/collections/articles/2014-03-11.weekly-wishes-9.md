<p>Each Monday night, I link up with <a href="http://thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to share my &#8220;wishes&#8221; or goals for the week and to see how I did on my goals last week. I know it&#8217;s Tuesday night, but better late than never! I had a late night at the office last night and just didn&#8217;t have the energy to boot my computer back up when I got home.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t do very well on my goals last week. I&#8217;m trying to cut myself some slack as things have been so, so busy at work.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:left;" align="center">Last Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Finish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Allegiant-Divergent-Series-Veronica-Roth/dp/006202406X" target="_blank">Allegiant</a>. </strong>I did! And I enjoyed it!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Do 15-20 minutes of French on the Duolingo app at least five days this week.</strong> I totally and completely slacked off on this goal. I didn&#8217;t do this once. It didn&#8217;t help that my travel agent told me we actually don&#8217;t need to know any French to get around well in Paris. I still want to know basics, but I&#8217;m lacking the motivation.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Meet my usual workout goal of getting to the gym at least four times during the week. </strong>Nope &#8211; I only went twice yet again.</p>
<p>4.<strong> Put together my February Project Life layout. </strong>I have a general layout, but I have to re-order some pictures that CVS messed up, and I just need to find the time to get a little more creative.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Decide on my next <a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/category/travel-with-me/" target="_blank">travel post</a> and get at least an outline drafted. </strong>I drafted a partial outline.</p>
<h1>This Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Start my spring cleaning by organizing and cleaning out our file cabinet. </strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Read half of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Workweek-Anywhere-Expanded/dp/0307465357" target="_blank">The 4-Hour Workweek</a>.</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>Do my usual exercise goal of going to the gym four times during the week.</strong> Once I start doing this more regularly, it will hopefully just be natural, and I won&#8217;t have to list it as a goal every week. I did find out this morning that they are yet again changing the class schedule at my gym though, so I&#8217;ll have to figure out a new routine again.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Finish my next <a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/category/travel-with-me/" target="_blank">travel post</a>. </strong></p>
