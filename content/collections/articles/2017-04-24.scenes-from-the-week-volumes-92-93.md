<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

Last weekend was a fun Easter celebration weekend at my in-laws&#8217; house in Fort Worth. This weekend I laid low and did practically nothing while my husband was away at a conference in Dallas.</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) While spending Easter weekend in Fort Worth with my in-laws, we had a nice outing downtown to try out a new-to-us restaurant.</p>
<p>(2) After lunch, we wandered around and picked up popsicles from a Steel City Pops stand in Sundance Square. It was a beautiful day!</p>
<p>(3) This past weekend, I took some of my free time to catch up on some blog posts. My sister Elizabeth and I had lunch Saturday and then headed to the next door coffee shop to get some work done.</p>
<p>(4) Sunday afternoon Daniel came home. After getting some lunch and resting, we went out to enjoy the beautiful weather on the Lady Bird Lake trails.</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching the movie <em>Lion</em> with Daniel and my in-laws. It was a great movie and did a great job telling an amazing true story. Have tissues nearby!</li>
<li>Attending a wonderful Easter service and Easter lunch prepared by my mother-in-law</li>
<li>Stopping by Waco to see my family and meet my cousin&#8217;s new baby on our way back home from Fort Worth</li>
<li>Enjoying a weeknight dinner with friends at Wu Chow, a delicious local Chinese restaurant</li>
<li>Seeing the end of busy season! Well, kind of&#8230;.</li>
<li>Getting lots and lots of sleep over this past weekend. I don&#8217;t think I realized I was capable of sleeping so well and so long that many nights in a row!</li>
<li>Finishing <em>The Good Fight</em>, the spinoff show of <em>The Good Wife</em>. It was really good &#8211; I highly recommend it! It has a lot of the same characters as <em>The Good Wife</em> and many new ones too.</li>
<li>Starting and finishing <em>It Ends With Us</em> by Colleen Hoover. I was hooked from the beginning and couldn&#8217;t put it down this weekend.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
