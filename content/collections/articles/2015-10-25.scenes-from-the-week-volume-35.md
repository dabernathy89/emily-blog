<p>Happy Sunday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. I also link up with <a href="http://siddathornton.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Lauren</a> for The Sunday Currently each week to share snippets from my Sunday afternoon which you&#8217;ll find at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t able to post last week, so I&#8217;ll do a little recap of last weekend (October 16-18) and then a recap of this weekend and my usual TSC.</p>

<p>(1) Friday night we went to see a Jon McLaughlin concert. Jon put on a fantastic show! I really enjoy his new album, and the concert focused mainly on his new music.</p>
<p>(2) Having friends in town means going around and playing tourist in my city. This weekend, we had some great friends in town and finally swung by and got a picture in from the of the &#8220;Greetings from Austin&#8221; mural!</p>
<p>(3) We went out to Salt Lick BBQ Saturday night. Yum! And looks at those pretty lights! Salt Lick manages to make waiting an hour for a table enjoyable.</p>
<p>(4) These are our friends Kaitlin and Erik that came to town, and we had a great time sharing our city with them. We ended their stay here with a nice walk around the river.</p>

<p>(1) This weekend was Baylor Homecoming! It was our first time to be able to make it as alumni, and I&#8217;m so glad that we did! The best part of the weekend was catching up with close friends from college that we hadn&#8217;t seen in years. Heather and Cody live in Alaska, so it was such a treat to see them right in Waco!</p>
<p>(2) We managed to get tickets to the game against Iowa State last-minute, so we got to experience our first game in the new stadium! We had a great time with my cousin and uncle cheering on our Bears.</p>
<p>(3) Another highlight of the weekend was seeing my sister Ellen. We wandered around campus a bit Sunday afternoon before heading back home. Love spending time with her!</p>
<p>(4) This is me, Daniel, and my cousin Josh having a blast at the game. It was pouring rain all weekend long, but we were lucky enough to have covered seats, so we just watched the rain fall on the field and didn&#8217;t get too wet ourselves.</p>
<p><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></p>
<p><em>Reading </em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Still-Life-Chief-Inspector-Gamache/dp/1250068738" target="_blank">Still Life</a>, book one of the Chief Inspector Gamache series</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>travel plans and work to-do lists</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to How To Get Away with Murder. This is such a good show to watch in the fall season!</p>
<p><em>Thinking </em> that I&#8217;m sleepy! It was a busy weekend (but so much fun!). Oh, and that I&#8217;m so grateful that the rain this weekend brought in some fall weather to Texas! Finally!</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> the Radiant Red Maple Bath and Body Works candle</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>for a productive and low-stress week</p>
<p><em>Wearing </em> pajamas. I&#8217;m about to go to bed.</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>the cooler weather and the fact that I got to wear a scarf to dinner tonight!</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to pull out my favorite snickerdoodle ice cream sandwich from the fridge for a quick snack before heading to bed</p>
<p><em>Watching  </em>How to Get Away with Murder currently</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to go to bed! I&#8217;ve got a bright and early morning.</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>cozy and happy</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>through pictures from this weekend. Lots of friends and family and green and gold&#8230;.</p>
<p>Happy Sunday! Have a great week.</p>
