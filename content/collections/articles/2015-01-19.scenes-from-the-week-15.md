<p>Happy Monday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these quick posts, I share the highlights from my week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events.</p>
<p>To be honest, I can&#8217;t remember what happened day-by-day last week. This just means I need to take more pictures to remind myself! But I do remember a couple of things:</p>
<p>1. Daniel made some delicious roasted veggies one night.</p>

<p>2. We tried out another coffee shop last week. Austin is FULL of great coffee shops, so we are trying to go work at a new one at least once a week.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BIRU-WP-209.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4186" src="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BIRU-WP-209-768x1024.jpeg" alt="BIRU-WP-209.jpeg" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BIRU-WP-209.jpeg 768w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BIRU-WP-209-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>3. We saw Wild with my sister and her boyfriend on Saturday night at the Alamo Drafthouse (right across the street from us!). I really liked the movie. It&#8217;s probably not something I&#8217;d watch again, but it&#8217;s a unique movie with fantastic acting and a good message.</p>
<p>4. I had to work basically the entire weekend. Boo&#8230;.</p>
<p>5. We really like the church we visited on Sunday.</p>
<p>6. I tried a queso omelette at Magnolia Cafe here in Austin on Sunday. It was DELICIOUS! It was an avocado and cheddar cheese omelette with actual queso poured on top. I&#8217;m going to off to go back another weekend to get it again!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BIRU-WP-210.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4187" src="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BIRU-WP-210-768x1024.jpeg" alt="BIRU-WP-210.jpeg" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BIRU-WP-210.jpeg 768w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BIRU-WP-210-225x300.jpeg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p>7. We went to Sprouts for the first time after brunch on Sunday. To me it was like a Trader Joe&#8217;s that carries normal brands in addition to their own store brand. I liked it a lot! I may make it a regular grocery stop (but not sure I want to give up Trader Joe&#8217;s just yet&#8230;).</p>
<p>I remembered more than I thought! Hopefully I&#8217;ll be back with more pictures in my next Scenes From the Week post next week. Have a great week!</p>
