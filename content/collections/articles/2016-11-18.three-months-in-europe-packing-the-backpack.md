If you&#8217;ve been reading along on my blog before, you&#8217;ve heard me talk about this countless times since I am in the middle of writing up <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/travel-with-me/" target="_blank">mini travel guides</a> to each of our stops in this adventure. I&#8217;ve also been saying all year that I&#8217;d share my packing list from this trip, and now I&#8217;m finally doing it!</p>
<p>Daniel and I have both had a heavy case of wanderlust for the past three or four years, and we&#8217;ve definitely done a lot more travel than the average person as a result of that. I&#8217;m also a fairly organized person and consider planning trips my favorite pastime. As  a result, planning the logistics and details for this trip was not very difficult for me for the most part. The one exception was figuring out how I could (and IF I could) pack for three months in a backpack. I had never been a light packer, and it made me nervous to think about packing for all that time away in something that I could carry around for hours at a time if necessary. I spent hours digging through packing blogs and videos and catering my packing list to our specific needs for our trip: a 2.5 month long backpacking trip around Western Europe during winter with destinations in both very cold (UK) and very mild (Italy) climates.</p>
<p>I ended up being very pleased with what I packed, so I&#8217;m happy to share this list with anyone who might be doing a similar type of trip. This works for a European backpacking trip of any length &#8211; you just have to do more loads of laundry the longer the trip.</p>

It had plenty of room for what I needed, and the detachable daypack was useful for carrying alone while sightseeing and for carrying valuables separate from the rest of my things while traveling by train (so I could put my larger backpack in the overhead bin and keep my valuables next to me). I also used <a href="http://amzn.to/2jl7uix" target="_blank">Eagle Creek Pack It Cubes<img loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=emilyabernath-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00F9S85CS" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></a> to stay organized and efficiently use the space I had. I&#8217;ve previously written in more detail about my backpack and packing accessories in <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2016/04/2016-favorites-packing-gear/" target="_blank">this post</a> on my travel packing favorites.</p>

<li>Curling iron with European adapter (for quick hair touchups)</li>
<li>One <a href="http://amzn.to/2jK9lds" target="_blank">North Face hooded parka</a> (This jacket is very light while still being warm and cozy, and it even handles a little snow just fine &#8211; perfect for a winter backpacking trip!)</li>
<li>1 pair of brown boots (that can be dressed up or down) &#8211; I wore <a href="http://amzn.to/2jjZ23h" target="_blank">these</a><img loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=emilyabernath-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00HDG6W2O" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> literally every single day of our trip!</li>
<li>Laptop</li>

<li>iPad Mini (for keeping up with loved ones at home and entertainment for train rides. Mine was loaded with books!)</li>
<li>Headphones (for audiobook and podcast listening on long train rides)</li>
<li>Luggage locks</li>
<li>Folder to hold important papers (e.g. rail passes, itineraries, etc.)</li>

<p>Now would you believe me if I told you that of all the pictures we took over the 2.5 month long trip (we took thousands!), we only have one of us with our backpacks? And you can&#8217;t even see the backpacks. I can&#8217;t believe it either. This picture shows us with our backpacks on during a long, snowy walk from the train station to our hotel in Glasgow. We weren&#8217;t as miserable as we look in the picture. 🙂 Our packing situation was perfect for the trip!</p>
