<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Month series!  In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous month ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have a little boy (with another on the way), everyday moments are extra special!</p>
<p>2020 is off to a wonderful start for us! I felt like I got a good mix of stillness, family time, productivity, and change. It seems like everyone is complaining about how long January has been. I feel like time still went fast but maybe just had a bit more breathing room &#8211; isn&#8217;t that what we all want? I loved it. While February is jam-packed, I&#8217;m hoping for a similar month to how January was.</p>

New Year&#8217;s Day was our Christmas morning at home. It was so fun to watch Carson see his new toy food truck for the first time and open up all his presents.</p>
<p>(2) That same day we headed to Austin for Mexican food at Hula Hut and then&#8230;.</p>
<p>(3) the Christmas lights show at Mozart&#8217;s! We had a wonderful New Year&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>(4) Carson brought home a Christmas craft from daycare. This one both cracks me up and makes my heart melt at the same time.</p>

It was perfect. We got beautiful snow&#8230;.</p>
<p>(2) an adorable town that was still decked out for Christmas&#8230;.</p>
<p>(3) mountains, a beautiful fireplace at the coziest bed and breakfast, and great food. I&#8217;ll share more about Whitefish in a future post!</p>
<p>(4) But we sure missed this guy. Carson has had a lot of fun baths this year with his new bath toys, including this fun fishing pole!</p>

I&#8217;m so grateful to have a part-time job that allows me this time during the week. One of Carson&#8217;s favorite things to do right now is play with this toy car in our backyard.</p>
<p>(2) Our final Christmas event in early January was a visit to a local lights display (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/maywaldchristmaslights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maywald Christmas Lights</a>). They won The Great Christmas Lights Fight TV show this year which added to the fun of visiting. I&#8217;m hoping to visit this lights display every Christmas season.</p>
<p>(3) My sister Elizabeth&#8217;s baby shower was in January. Elizabeth, my mom, and I had a fun day trip to Dallas for the shower, and on the way back, we met my brother Ben in Waco for dinner. It was good to catch up!</p>
<p>(4) Carson received this Thomas the Tank Engine toy for Christmas and loves pushing it around with his head low to the ground so he can watch the wheels turn. I&#8217;m not sure why this toy has monkeys or why Thomas is wearing a crown on his head, but he loves it!</p>
<p>Finally, I wanted to share my &#8220;Decade in Review&#8221; that I posted to InstaStories. This took a long time to put together, so I wanted to save it for more than the 24 hours on InstaStories!</p>
