<p>Yesterday I flew from DC to Waco, TX, and now I&#8217;m with my family in my parents&#8217; new house! I have had a great time this weekend getting to visit with my sisters and brother and cousin and grandparents and parents. Tonight my sister Ellen and I went and had dinner with some of her college friends. We have a lot more fun in store for this week too!</p>
<p>The main reason I&#8217;m in Texas is because I&#8217;m in a friend&#8217;s wedding next Saturday, but I decided to come down early to spend time with the family. With my job, I&#8217;m able to work remotely at times which is a really nice perk for situations like this.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Out-The-Easy-Ruta-Sepetys/dp/039925692X#" target="_blank">Out of the Easy</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/05/01/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge/" target="_blank">Semi-Charmed Summer 2014 Book Challenge</a></p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>not too much. Enjoying time with family!</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to our family cat Tim meowing out in the hall</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I am EXHAUSTED. Friday night I really only slept an hour or two. I had a 6am flight yesterday morning and what little sleep I got before leaving the apartment at 4am was broken by my own cat meowing and exploring around the room</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  the scent of the Tea Tree toner water I use from Lush. So refreshing!</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to go right to sleep as soon as I publish this post</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>pajamas &#8211; it&#8217;s bedtime!</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> being in Waco. The dinner we went to tonight was on Baylor&#8217;s campus (where I went to college), so of course lots of good memories came to me while we were there!</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>Daniel here with me! He won&#8217;t be joining me in Texas until Friday.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> sleeeepp. I&#8217;m just so tired right now.<br />

<p><em>Feeling</em>  content and blessed</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>through some book reviews on Amazon</p>
