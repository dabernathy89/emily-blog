<p>Hello! Happy Monday! I hope that everyone&#8217;s week is starting out nicely. So far, mine has been good, but it&#8217;s sure hard to switch out of vacation mode! At least it&#8217;s a short week &#8211; my company gives us a 4 day weekend for Memorial Day starting with Friday.</p>
<p>Since we are packing up again and heading to Charleston this Thursday, I&#8217;m not going to set many goals this week. I&#8217;m hoping to get back on track after Memorial Day!</p>
<p>In case you are new here, each week I share goals that I would like to achieve in the week ahead and discuss my progress on last week&#8217;s goals by linking up with <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> and sharing a Weekly Wishes post. At the beginning of each month, I post goals for the month rather than just for the week.</p>
<h1>This Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Finish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bittersweet-Thoughts-Change-Grace-Learning/dp/0310328160" target="_blank">Bittersweet: Thoughts on Change, Grace, and Learning the Hard Way</a> &#8211;  </strong>Gotta catch up for the<a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/05/01/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge/" target="_blank"> Summer Reading Challenge</a> I&#8217;m participating in!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Organize and edit vacation photos.</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>Get back to the gym! </strong>Starting with my 6am spin class in the morning. 🙂</p>
<p>Have a good week!</p>
