<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>(1) We found yet another great coffee shop in Austin, Flat Track Coffee. The coffee shop shares a space with a bike repair store which makes for a pretty unique atmosphere. They had this cool branded van sitting outside!</p>
<p>(2) We are still going strong on Whole30 (8 days left&#8230;.), but we got sick of cooking and cleaning every single day, so we have found a few options for eating out. One of my favorites we&#8217;ve found is an acai bowl from Blenders and Bowls. We had to make several substitutes and skip the honey and granola, but it was easy to do! Also, I&#8217;m really learning to love almond butter, and it was especially tasty in this acai bowl!</p>
<p>(3) Saturday we took a trip to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond to pick up a bunch of things for our guest bedroom/office! Let&#8217;s just say, we were pumped to have the 20% off your WHOLE ORDER coupon because we spent quite a chunk of change. Our guest bed and mattresses should be coming in this week, so I can&#8217;t wait to put the bedroom together next weekend! We really look forward to having a comfortable space for guests to stay (that&#8217;s not in the middle of the living room in a 700 sq. ft. apartment!).</p>
<p>(4) I had some time on Sunday to just chill, so I did this almond foot mask I&#8217;ve had on hand for a few months while reading a book (currently reading <a href="http://amzn.to/2jQtfY1" target="_blank">The Last Anniversary</a>) and sipping some tea. This is what Sunday afternoons are made for!</p>
