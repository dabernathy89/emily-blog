<p>Happy Sunday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. I also link up with <a href="http://siddathornton.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Lauren </a>for The Sunday Currently each week to share snippets from my Sunday afternoon which you&#8217;ll find at the bottom of this post.</p>

<p>(1) Saturday afternoon, we had good friends over to watch the Baylor vs. Tech game (Sic &#8216;Em!). While Daniel and I are not the best football fans, it sure is fun to cheer on our alma mater and enjoy the company of good friends we&#8217;ve known since middle school!</p>
<p>(2) Sunday after church we took a little excursion. We first stopped at Pieous, a fabulous pizza place on the way out to the hill country. This restaurant was so great that it deserves half of my photo matrix this week. We started out with the freshest, lightest caesar salad, then we had a white pizza with arugula, prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, and olive oil, and we finished off with the most delicious blueberry pie I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>
<p>(3) This is the most delicious blueberry pie I&#8217;ve ever had! See (2) above.</p>
<p>(4) After lunch we made our way further into the hill country to visit the winery where we are members (<a href="http://pedernalescellars.com/" target="_blank">Pedernales Cellars</a>). We went to pick up our quarterly set of wine and to enjoy a tasting and a glass of wine out on the patio that overlooks the hills. It was a peaceful afternoon together.</p>

<li>ACL (a major music festival) is in full swing here in Austin, and we live just around the corner from it. This year we decided to not splurge on a ticket, but I hope we are able to next year. It seems a shame to live walking distance from such a well-known event and to never attend.</li>
<li>Saturday morning we had delicious breakfast tacos made by my talented sister. They were hosting a pre-ACL breakfast, and we got to enjoy even though we didn&#8217;t go to ACL.</li>
<li>This week I discovered Ben Howard and his Every Kingdom album. It&#8217;s a good one! I&#8217;m looking forward to playing it over and over during my upcoming busy week at work.</li>

<h4><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></h4>
<p><em>Reading </em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Martian-Novel-Andy-Weir-ebook/dp/B00EMXBDMA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442786757&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+martian+book" target="_blank">The Martian</a>. I&#8217;ve been in a reading rut, but I&#8217;m hoping that I post a new book here soon. Also, I&#8217;m nearly done listening to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Me-Before-You-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0143124544" target="_blank">Me Before You</a> on audiobook, and I&#8217;m very much looking forward to starting the sequel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/After-You-Novel-Jojo-Moyes-ebook/dp/B00TY3ZKG8/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443993696&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=after+you" target="_blank">After You</a>, that just came out. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed slowly listening through this book.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>trip plans&#8230;. So fun! November will be a fun month of travel.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to Snow Patrol, an old favorite. I love this band and all the memories that come back when I listen to them.</p>
<p><em>Thinking </em> that I&#8217;m loving the organization of my desk now. My husband&#8217;s last day at his job was last Friday, and he starts freelancing full-time tomorrow. Because of that, he has cleared off all of his stuff from our built-in desk and plans to put it on a new standing desk on the other side of the apartment. He has been standing at work for at least two years now and wants to keep that habit at home.</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> the Pumpkin Apple wall plug-in. Yum!</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>that Moses, the child we sponsor in Uganda, has a wonderful birthday month! He turns 14 this month. We sponsor him through Compassion International, an organization near and dear to my heart.</p>
<p><em>Wearing </em> a cotton dress</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>Ben Howard &#8211; see top part of this post!</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>that cool fall weather! Come on, you can do it, Texas!</p>
<p><em>Watching  </em>Law and Order: SVU. Love it!</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to get back into music. I&#8217;ve been wanting to get back to piano lessons for years, but I&#8217;ve always thought I wouldn&#8217;t have time with my job. Maybe I should just give it a shot!</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>excited</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>SeatGuru.com to make sure that the seats we&#8217;ve chosen for our upcoming flights are decent</p>
<p>Happy Sunday!</p>
