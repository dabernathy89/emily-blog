<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

I know I did. We spent time with my family in Waco and in Garland, and we also went to the (very sad) Baylor/Tech game at Cowboy Stadium on Friday. We also saw lots of extended family members, ate several delicious meals, saw my brother&#8217;s dorm room at Baylor, played games (ping-pong and Ticket to Ride), and cozied up on the couch to watch all of the new Gilmore Girls season.</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) This is me with my grandparents, Mimi and Papa. Both of them have had serious health issues that they&#8217;ve overcome over the past year, and I was so grateful to be able to hug them and see them happy and healthy for Thanksgiving this year. Papa never smiles in pictures, but I asked asked if he&#8217;d smile for me in this one, and he did!</p>
<p>(2) As I mentioned above, we played ping-pong over the weekend. My great-aunt in Garland has a ping-pong table, so she pulled it out for Thanksgiving Day. The weather was perfect on Thanksgiving!</p>
<p>(3) As I also mentioned above, we went to the Baylor/Tech game in Dallas. The experience with my family in Cowboy Stadium was cool, and we did a fun tailgate before the game, but we won&#8217;t talk about the rest&#8230;.</p>
<p>(4) Saturday night we played a game of Ticket to Ride, which is always fun!</p>

<li>Watching the Thanksgiving episode of This is Us. Y&#8217;all, that show is just SO GOOD.</li>
<li>Going to happy hour with friends at The Roosevelt Room, a neat little bar near my office</li>
<li>Watching Gilmore Girls and loving it (except for the very end). Stars Hollow was just as amazing as ever in every detail, and they brought back all of the characters, even many of the minor ones. However, I won&#8217;t spoil anything, but I will say I was looking for closure of the series, and I thought they were closing out nicely until the last few seconds.</li>
<li>Going through lots of old family photos to put in my own Dropbox account. There are so many photos of memories I had forgotten about, and it made me very nostalgic.</li>
<li>Changing our minds about moving&#8230;. Remember that two bedroom apartment I said we decided against last week? Well, we ran some numbers the next day and put a lot more thought into it. We are moving! And to top it all off, we are moving THIS Wednesday, AND I won&#8217;t even be home to help. I&#8217;ll be at a work training in Orlando, so Daniel is kind of on his own. We have movers coming to help with the big things and friends who have offered to help with the other stuff, so he is not really alone, but I definitely am getting the good end of the deal. We turn in the keys to our old place Friday morning, and I&#8217;ll come home Thursday night to our apartment mostly moved out. We will see how it goes! We are very excited for the extra space and the good deal that we got, and it is nice that we are just moving units in the same apartment building.</li>
