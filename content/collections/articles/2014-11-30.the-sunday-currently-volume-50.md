<p>Happy Sunday! How was everyone&#8217;s Thanksgiving? Ours was fantastic. The last of my family left the area yesterday after a wonderful week of relaxing and eating and game playing and movie watching and family bonding. Ever since they left it has been a whirlwind getting into moving mode. It&#8217;s a bit stressful, but the excitement of moving back to the South will get us through it.</p>
<p><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></p>
<p><em>Reading </em> Lena Dunham&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Not-That-Kind-Girl-Learned/dp/081299499X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417389087&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=not+that+kind+of+girl" target="_blank">Not That Kind of Girl</a></p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>a humongous moving to-do list</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to Nashville on the TV</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>about all of the Cyber Monday shopping I need to do tomorrow</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> a new candle &#8211; Pumpkin Gingerbread!</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to be able to enjoy the holiday season despite preparing for a move across the country and needing to find a new place to live all within the next month</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>sweats and a t-shirt, but I need to run and put on something nice really soon because we are going to see A Christmas Carol at Ford&#8217;s Theater tonight! Yay!</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>looking through all of the lovely pictures from our Thanksgiving week</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>coffee coffee coffee</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to watch some Christmas movies! I&#8217;ve watched one random movie I found on Netflix (The Fitzgerald Family Christmas), and I watched The Holiday with my sisters and mom, but I have so many more I&#8217;d like to watch in the next month.</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>stressed but motivated</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>Cyber Monday ads. I&#8217;m not nearly as ready for the huge online shopping day as I usually am.</p>
<p>Question for you all &#8211; My husband and I are taking one last trip before our move this week. We leave for NYC this Thursday and will stay until Sunday. Does anyone have any great restaurant recommendations or other suggestions? We can&#8217;t wait to soak in the Christmasy surroundings in the city!</p>
