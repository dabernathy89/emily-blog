<p>Oh, January, where did you go? You were so busy, but I somehow managed to do pretty well on my goals!</p>
<h2>January Review</h2>
<h3>Read the <a href="http://shereadstruth.com/category/plans/john/" target="_blank">current SheReadsTruth plan</a> and journal every single morning.</h3>
<p>I read through the whole John study, and I&#8217;ve started the Esther study. I&#8217;m hoping this will be a daily habit that I never break.</p>
<h3>Get back to my gym classes.</h3>
<p>I went a couple of times but due to several really late nights of working, I did not get up early enough most days.</p>
<h3>Set up a budget and be ready to stick to it by February.</h3>
<p>Our budget is all set up in <a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/?gclid=CjwKEAiAxsymBRCegqiLzI7Q1S8SJADOgQrzFsx2R1XPE8Rks4g2Iur5Kf8_R0vp7FZYeKlgmwhBBxoCyKDw_wcB" target="_blank">YNAB</a>, and we are now tracking every purchase. It will take a couple of months to create a budget that is realistic for us, but writing it down and tracking our spending is a great first step.</p>
<h3>Meal plan and grocery shop every weekend.</h3>
<p>We were great with this this month!</p>
<h3>Start catching up on <a href="http://beckyhiggins.com/project-life/" target="_blank">Project Life</a> (digitally).</h3>
<p>I did this too!! The digital version is much more realistic for me &#8211; I&#8217;m getting pages done much more quickly.</p>
<h3>Read two books.</h3>
<p>Does one and a half count?</p>
<h2>February Goals</h2>
<h3>Create a daily cleaning schedule.</h3>
<p>I used to be good at having a set cleaning plan for each day of the week. I really liked that because I didn&#8217;t have to set aside an entire afternoon on the weekend just to keep things clean. I&#8217;m ready to get back into the habit!</p>
<h3>Start Donald Miller&#8217;s and Shana Niequist&#8217;s Creating Your Life Plan study.</h3>
<p>I purchased this last month because I got an email saying that it wasn&#8217;t going to be sold anymore after last month. I&#8217;m really looking forward to working through this course written by two of my very favorite authors!</p>
<h3>Put up the apartment decorations that we have.</h3>
<p>I have dreams up purchasing a new rug and some wall decor for the apartment, but right now I just want to focus on hanging up the decorations we already have. For some reason, I keep putting that off.</p>
<h3>Get plugged back in to the blogging community.</h3>
<p>Last fall I started participating in more link-ups and getting involved in the Peony Project Facebook group. I&#8217;m ready to jump back into both and be diligent about commenting on other blogs and participating in this wonderful blogging community.</p>
<h3>Get set up on my new Macbook Air.</h3>
<p>Yup, I have a new laptop! It&#8217;s actually my husband&#8217;s old laptop, but his work just purchased him a new one, so I get it. So, after over a year of blogging almost completely on my iPad and on my work computer (which blocks a lot of programs and other things I want to do with the blog), I&#8217;m going to have my own computer! I&#8217;m so excited to have a place to store photos and edit them and do all kinds of things for the blog! I&#8217;ve never used a Mac before, so there will be a learning curve (especially because I use a PC for work), but I&#8217;m looking forward to the challenge.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! I&#8217;m pretty excited about these goals. Have a great weekend, everyone!!</p>
