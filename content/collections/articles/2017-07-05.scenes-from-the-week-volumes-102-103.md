<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

They included a weekend at home full of doing things around the apartment and trying new places in Austin, and they also included the long weekend for the Fourth of July! Over the holiday weekend, we spent most of it with my parents and brother in Waco, but we drove to East Texas to visit my grandparents on Monday and back to Austin that same day so that we could go to our local fireworks show for the 4th.</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) During our weekend at home, we took a Knife Skills 101 class at Sur La Table. We didn&#8217;t love this class as much as the seafood cooking one we did for my birthday, but I learned some skills that will be helpful &#8211; primarily how to cut an onion properly!</p>
<p>(2) My parents took us to several fun new (to us) places in Waco during our visit last weekend. One of them was Hey Sugar, a fun shop selling ice cream, sodas, candy, and basically anything sugary! My dad snapped this photo of the rest of us outside of the shop right after we filled our bellies with treats.</p>
<p>(3) This is group who went to the fireworks show at Auditorium Shores in Austin for the 4th! We got there really early and snagged a picnic table at first where we ate our packed picnic snacks and played games. Then we went to our spot on the lawn to listen to the Symphony play and watch the fireworks show.</p>
<p>(4) As you can see, we had the best view of fireworks! This was the best fireworks show I have seen outside of Disney World!</p>

<li>Over the past two weeks, the new Austin restaurants we&#8217;ve tried include Tumble 22 (Nashville hot chicken), Contigo, Regal Ravioli, The Tasty Spoon (gelato), PS35 (pizza), and Wright Bros Brew &amp; Brew (coffee). I give all of these a big thumbs up! It&#8217;s been a great couple weeks of eating in ATX.</li>
<li>Attending my first ever blogger meetup hosted at St. Elmo&#8217;s Brewery by Kelsey at <a href="http://www.somuchlife.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">So Much Life</a> blog! It was really neat to meet a few familiar faces from the ATX blog world and to meet several new ones as well.</li>
<li>Going to see <em>Paris Can Wait</em> at the Violet Crown. We really enjoyed the Violet Crown theater, and despite the complaints in reviews of the movie being too slow and lacking in the storytelling department, I loved the scenes of the French countryside and French food, and I thought that the story was pretty cute. I recommend it, but you will definitely get a case of wanderlust from watching, so be prepared!</li>
<li>A fun game of Ticket to Ride Europe with the family. I won! 🙂</li>
<li>Going through several boxes of my old things that have been hanging out in my parents&#8217; attic for a long time. I found so many momentos that I had completely forgotten about including my old POGS collection (remember those?), a scrapbook from my kindergarten field trip to Albertson&#8217;s and McDonald&#8217;s, the sweet baby book my mom put together for me, and notes passed back and forth with friends during class over the years. I kept a few things and took photos of several of the other things before getting rid of them.</li>
<li>Visiting with my grandparents at their home in East Texas. We had a great time eating BBQ, watching home movies, picking fresh tomatoes from my grandpa&#8217;s garden, and catching up on life. I love them so much!</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
