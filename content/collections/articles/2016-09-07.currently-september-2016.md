</a><em><strong>Reading</strong></em> | <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Life-Violet-Grant/dp/0425274845/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473212961&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+secret+life+of+violet+grant" target="_blank"><em>The Secret Life of Violet Grant</em></a>. I actually just finished this book, and I loved it! It&#8217;s my second out of three Schuyler sister books by Beatriz Williams, and I really enjoy how the author writes. I highly recommend it! I think I&#8217;m about to start reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473213054&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mr+penumbra%27s+24-hour+bookstore" target="_blank">Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</a>. Have any of you read it? It looks interesting! I&#8217;ve also been flipping through lots of wonderful travel magazines lately.</p>
<p><em><strong>Trying</strong></em> |<i> </i>To get up early every day. I&#8217;ve been pretty good about getting up early on weekdays (see a typical weekday for me <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2016/09/a-day-in-the-life-09-01-16/" target="_blank">here</a>), but it never gets easier because I &#8220;reset&#8221; my body clock each weekend by getting way too much sleep. I&#8217;ve always wanted to be a morning person, but I&#8217;ve never been able to naturally wake up early. I think the only way I&#8217;ll be able to do that is if I stop sleeping in on the weekends. Does anyone have any tips on that? It&#8217;s just so hard when you don&#8217;t have to be up for anything in particular.</p>
<p><b><em>Hoping</em> </b>| To make the most out of the next two weekends at home. Once those are over, it&#8217;s a whirlwind of packed (but so fun!) weekends ahead. I need to get home projects and blogging done and not let the free time slip away from me.</p>
<p><strong><em>Decorating</em> </strong>| My apartment for fall soon. I love putting out the fall decorations, and I especially love my fall candles! Also, I recently hung up ten travel prints from a Rifle Paper Company calendar on my living room wall, and I love what they add to the room!</p>
<p><em><strong>To-do listing</strong></em> | Things to get done at work. I have a huge deadline next week, and I have so much to get done before it! Each year the work ends up getting done, but I never know how it will before it does. Can&#8217;t wait for it to be over!</p>
