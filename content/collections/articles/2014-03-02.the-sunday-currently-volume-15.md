<p>This is us on the metro going into DC last night to celebrate our good friend&#8217;s birthday!</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading </em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Allegiant-Divergent-Series-Veronica-Roth/dp/006202406X">Allegiant</a> by Veronica Roth for fun and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Compassion-Reflection-Christian-Henri-Nouwen/dp/0385517521/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393778816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=compassion+a+reflection+on+the+christian+life" target="_blank">Compassion: A Reflection on Christian Life</a> by Henri Nouwen for my small group</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>my thoughts as I read this week&#8217;s section of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Compassion-Reflection-Christian-Henri-Nouwen/dp/0385517521/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393778816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=compassion+a+reflection+on+the+christian+life" target="_blank">Compassion</a></p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYFOuptGtBs" target="_blank">a Conan O&#8217;Brien interview with Barkhad Abdi</a>, the leading pirate in the movie Captain Phillips. He seems like a really nice guy. Before getting this role, he was chauffeur in Minnesota. It&#8217;s interesting to hear his perspective on working with Tom Hanks!</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I can&#8217;t believe we have yet another winter storm heading our way</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  the same Sweet Vanilla Cinnamon candle I&#8217;ve been burning for a couple months now</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> that May would hurry up and get here already. Most of the time, I&#8217;m not one to wish away precious time, but this time of year it&#8217;s hard not too &#8211; especially with so many fun plans in the works for May!</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to put together a meal plan with cheap ingredients for this week. We have spent a lot of money this weekend between haircuts and eating out and running errands, so I&#8217;m hoping to ease the blow on the credit card by eating cheaply this week.</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>pajamas</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>Sundays with no obligations. They are becoming more frequent lately, and it is a very nice tradition.</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to drink enough water today. I&#8217;m really good at drinking plenty of water at work with my tumbler sitting next to m e, but I find myself drinking very little water on the weekends.</p>
<p><em>Needing  </em>an idea for a blog post this week</p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  very sleepy. I might need a nap today.</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>my usual YouTube channels and blogs<a href="https://twitter.com/siddathornton"><br />
