<p>Today we are in Charleston, SC exploring this cute city with our friends Kaitlin and Erik and eating amazing Southern food. We arrived Friday morning, and we head back home tonight on the over-night train, so I pre-wrote this post. I&#8217;ve never done that for a TSC post before, so we will see how it goes! Seems weird to write what you will be &#8220;currently&#8221; doing in the future&#8230;. 😉</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Someday-Maybe-A-Novel/dp/0345532740" target="_blank">Someday, Someday, Maybe</a> by Lauren Graham hopefully! If not, that means I&#8217;m reading too slowly and still finishing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bittersweet-Thoughts-Change-Grace-Learning/dp/0310328160#" target="_blank">Bittersweet: Thoughts on Change, Grace, and Learning the Hard Way</a>.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>probably nothing. But I bet I&#8217;m making a mental list of the last few things we want to do before we leave Charleston!</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to the Memorial Day weekend crowds surrounding me</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I&#8217;m really going to miss the South&#8230; But not for long! It&#8217;s almost time for a visit home in Texas. 🙂</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  the outdoors and good, Southern home cookin&#8217;!</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to not have to wait too long for brunch this morning. There are very few restaurants in Charleston that take reservations for brunch, so we will definitely have some sort of wait!</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>probably shorts and a button-up shirt. This will be the first time I have worn shorts outside this year!</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> the colorful homes and cobblestone streets of Charleston</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to be able to sleep on the over-night train tonight</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> coffee, probably<br />
<del></del></p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  both exhausted and thrilled to be on a trip again</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>nothing, I hope! I better be outside enjoying the weather and the city.</p>
