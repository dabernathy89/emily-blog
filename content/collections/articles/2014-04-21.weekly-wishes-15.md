<p>Well, last week flew by, didn&#8217;t it? Daniel and I just got back from a nice walk outside after having yummy <a href="http://mixandmatchmama.blogspot.com/2012/01/dinner-tonight-brisket-tacos.html" target="_blank">slow-cooker brisket tacos</a> for dinner. The weather is beautiful here today! Now I&#8217;m watching YouTube videos and writing this post from bed. 🙂 It has been a great evening!</p>
<h1>Last Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Finish The Cuckoo&#8217;s Calling.</strong> Finally done! It was an interesting book, and I enjoyed the plot twist. I did, however, find the first half of the book very slow. It might have been because I was exhausted every day during the time I was reading the first half, so I may not be the best judge. But I really enjoyed the last half.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Choose and print out my pictures for my March Project Life pages. </strong>Picked out my prints and sent in the order to Target Photo, but I haven&#8217;t picked them up yet.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Conquer the dresser! </strong>Done! My drawers are nice and organized, and I found some things to give away and throw away.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Meal plan for next week. </strong>I did this on Saturday. I&#8217;m already really enjoying the benefits (see dinner reference above), and we are set for the week!</p>
<h1>This Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Put together my March Project Life layout.</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Next book up is&#8230;. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Film-Novel-Marisha-Pessl/dp/140006788X" target="_blank">Night Film</a> by </strong><span style="color:#666666;"><strong>Marisha Pessl.</strong> <strong>I want to read at least 1/3 of it this week to stay on track with my annual goal of reading 24 books.</strong> I put this on my reading list a LONG time ago back when Crystal at <a href="http://www.dreams-etc.com/" target="_blank">Dreams, Etc.</a> highly recommended it, and it was finally my turn for it at the library this week. Very excited!</span></p>
<p>3. <strong>Get winter coats dry-cleaned and put away in storage. </strong>I don&#8217;t think I will be needing those for a while!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for this week! Daniel&#8217;s brother is coming to town Thursday through Saturday, so we want to have plenty of time to spend with him. We are excited to have him! Have a fantastic week!</p>
