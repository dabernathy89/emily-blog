<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>(1) Friday night Daniel really wanted to BBQ, so we talked down the street to our nearby favorite BBQ place. Little did we know that we&#8217;d be eating BBQ again the next day for dinner. Right after dinner we went to see Finding Dory which was so, so cute! 🙂 I highly recommend the movie, even for adults.</p>
<p>(2) Saturday we drove out to Enchanted Rock for a Fathers&#8217; Day Weekend hike. This was the view from about half-way up the hike on the rock. I always forget that Texas can be so gorgeous until I&#8217;m in the Hill Country. I feel so lucky to live so close to it!</p>
<p>(3) After hiking at Enchanted Rock, we drove into the town of Llano where my parents were staying in a hotel. Some of the group napped and rested at the hotel, and the rest of us went out and explored Llano. Little did I know that Llano had such cute little shops! This is a picture of Daniel, my sisters, and Jason walking next to the Llano dam with a cool bridge in the background.</p>
<p>(4) After exploring, everyone met up for a delicious dinner at Cooper&#8217;s. Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t fit both Daniel and the Cooper&#8217;s name in the picture, but Daniel was so excited to visit his favorite restaurant of all time that I had to share. Even though we now have a Cooper&#8217;s five minutes from our apartment in Austin, Daniel has memories of stopping at the Llano location on the way home from summer camp each year, so this is his favorite location. I actually thought that the brisket and ribs were better at this location too.</p>
