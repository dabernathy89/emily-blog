<h1 style="text-align:left;" align="center"></h1>
<p>Sometimes, it&#8217;s the little things that make me smile. Like this coffee mug that my sister gave me filled with my favorite brew &#8211; Starbucks Blonde Roast. Simple blog post link-ups like this one also make me very happy!</p>
<p>Each Monday night, I link up with <a href="http://thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to share my &#8220;wishes&#8221; or goals for the week and to see how I did on my goals last week. Here we go!</p>
<h1 style="text-align:left;" align="center">Last Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Set up my new planner. &#8211; </strong>I did this! I&#8217;m going to start using Monday nights to plan the rest of the week in my planner while I write these Weekly Wishes.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Read the rest of the Book Thief. &#8211;</strong>Done! Book Club was fun!</p>
<p>3. <strong>Make it to  6am cycling class tomorrow and Wednesday morning, BodyPump Thursday evening, yoga on Saturday, and BodyPump again on Sunday. </strong>&#8211; I kind of failed on this one. I didn&#8217;t make either morning cycling class or Saturday yoga, but I did go to Thursday and Sunday BodyPump. I know it&#8217;s not a great excuse, but the freezing cold weather is what prevented me from getting out of my warm bed for morning classes. I have a legitimate excuse for Saturday &#8211; I was sick.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Get a good chunk of my next<a title="Travel with Me // New England (Part I)" href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/2013/11/21/travel-with-me-new-england-part-i/" target="_blank"> Travel with Me</a> post written and ready to post next week.  </strong>&#8211; I did write good chunk! I&#8217;m almost finished and it should be posted Thursday or Friday.</p>
<p>5. <b>Get pictures printed for my first Project Life layout. &#8211; </b>I didn&#8217;t do this because I decided to wait until the end of each month to compile a layout or two for the full month. Instead of this, I backed up all my pictures from my old computer onto my iPad and Dropbox. That was quite a task!</p>
<h1>This Week</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Finish my next <a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/category/travel-with-me/" target="_blank">Travel with Me</a> post and write three more posts to schedule out over the next few weeks.</strong> <strong>&#8211; </strong>I will be very busy with work in February, but I don&#8217;t want to abandon my blog during that time!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Read half of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Is-Where-Leave-You/dp/0452296366" target="_blank">This is Where I Leave You</a>. &#8211; </strong>On my<a title="The Sunday Currently, Volume 11" href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/01/26/the-sunday-currently-volume-11/" target="_blank"> TSC post</a> this week, I said I was starting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cuckoos-Calling-Robert-Galbraith/dp/0316206849/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390870911&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+cuckoo%27s+calling" target="_blank">The Cuckoo&#8217;s Calling</a>. I had an unfortunate incident downloading this book onto my Nook, and I lost it. 🙁 Now I have to wait in line all over again for my turn to get this book. Oh well! There are plenty of other books to read in the meantime.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Make it to  6am cycling class tomorrow, BodyPump Thursday evening, and BodyPump again on Sunday. </strong>-This is a reduced goal from last week, but with my workload this week, I&#8217;ll be really happy if I make it to just these classes.</p>
<p>4. <b>Spend time with Daniel and get as much rest as possible. </b>&#8211; It&#8217;s going to be a long February.</p>
