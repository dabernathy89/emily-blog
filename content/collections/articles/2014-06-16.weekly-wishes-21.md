<p>Hi friends! I&#8217;m writing this from the DFW airport as we wait for our flight home to DC from Texas. We board in less than 30 minutes, so I&#8217;ll try to get my thoughts together as quickly as I can.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning on taking a slightly different approach to Weekly Wishes &#8211; at least for the summer. I&#8217;ll still be linking up with <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> each week, but I want to change how I do my goals. In the past, I&#8217;ve been following the way that Melyssa (blogger at The Nectar Collective) does her Weekly Wishes &#8211; one set of monthly goals at the beginning of the month and then a new set of weekly goals at the beginning of each week. I found that I was forgetting my monthly goals nearly every month because I was focusing so much on my weekly goals. Now I&#8217;d like to use my Monday post to basically just track my goals for the entire month, and I might add in a new goal here and there if there is something else I want to get done. But I&#8217;m tired of disappointing myself by setting too many goals, so I think that this will work better for me. We shall see! With all of that said, here are my goals for June as well as the progress I have made on them.</p>
<h1>June Goals</h1>
<p>1. <strong>Read three books. </strong>I&#8217;m very behind on this goal, but I think that I can catch up. I plan to finish Out of the Easy this week and quickly jump into my next read.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Actually clean out my closet and get rid of clothes I no longer wear.</strong> I haven&#8217;t done this yet, but I&#8217;m going to be home for the rest of the month and don&#8217;t think this will be a problem.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Make a game plan for revamping my blog design and layout. </strong>I have some plans on paper, so that&#8217;s a start!</p>
<p>4. <strong>Create my April Project Life layout. </strong>Again, this is something I think that I can do now that I will be home for the rest of the month. As a bonus, I can work on this while catching up on some of my favorite shows&#8230;. 😉</p>
<p>5. <strong>Organize my blog feed.</strong> Not yet, but this is something I can easily work on while lounging around on a weeknight.</p>
