In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>
<p>(1) We live right next door to Uchi, one of the most popular restaurants in Austin, but we don&#8217;t go very much because it&#8217;s pricey. We had always heard that they had one of the best happy hours in town with low-priced sushi rolls, but we were never able to get there in time after work. Since this was my last week off from work, we took advantage and made reservations for happy hour, and it was great!</p>
<p>(2) I got in lots of snuggles with my cat Banana this week. I woke up to this one morning after Daniel had already left for the gym.</p>
<p>(3) I did it. I went and waited&#8230;. and WAITED&#8230; for Franklin&#8217;s BBQ. We thought we were being smart by going on a Wednesday. We arrived at 10am. Franklin&#8217;s opens at 11am. We didn&#8217;t eat until 1:30pm! I never would have gone if I&#8217;d known we would wait that long for lunch, but I&#8217;m glad we did it. I feel like this is something you have to check off your list if you live in Austin. Yes, the BBQ was incredible. It was the best we&#8217;d ever had! Daniel agrees, and he&#8217;s a BBQ snob.</p>
<p>(4) We took lots of evening walks this week and enjoyed a few great sunsets. 🙂</p>

<li>Several meals with friends throughout the week</li>
<li>A beautiful Saturday afternoon hike with bluebonnets galore!</li>
<li>I finished the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Light-We-Cannot-See/dp/1476746583/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459736658&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=all+the+light+we+cannot+see" target="_blank">All the Light We Cannot See</a> and absolutely loved it.</li>
<li>We celebrated Daniel&#8217;s grandmother Sunday night. She passed away this week, and we went to Fort Worth for a celebration service in her honor Sunday evening. She was so loved by her family and friends, and we know she is at home with the Lord, her husband, and many other loved ones now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s back to work and the real world for me this week. I hope that you all have a great week and soak in the gorgeous spring weather while it&#8217;s still here!</p>
