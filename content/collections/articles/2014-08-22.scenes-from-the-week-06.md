<p><span id=":179" dir="ltr" style="color: #222222;">Happy Friday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts I share the highlights from my week &#8211; from memorable events to the small things that made me smile.</span> Here is a glimpse into this past week:</p>
<h1>Monday</h1>
<p>I worked pretty late and ate dinner at the office. After work, I did some reading and blogging and took a nice, hot bubble bath.</p>
<h1>Tuesday</h1>
<p>I met Kaitlin for our 6am cycling class at the gym. That made for a nice, relaxing morning after getting back home from the gym because I typically don&#8217;t need to leave for work until 8:15. I always enjoy getting in my workouts in the morning; it makes me feel energized and productive for the rest of the day!</p>
<p>After work Daniel and I ate one of our freezer meals that I had prepared on Saturday, and we started watching Season 3 of Homeland. After over a year of waiting, the third season is finally for sale, and we can watch it! Somehow, we have made it this long without running into any spoilers. After the episode, it was back to work for both of us &#8211; but not without a honey vanilla hot tea!</p>

<h1>Wednesday</h1>
<p>Wednesday dinner was at the office again. I was still able to get home at a decent hour to hang out with Daniel and wrap up my <a title="Travel With Me // Paris – What We Did" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/08/travel-with-me-paris-what-we-did/" target="_blank">Paris trip recap</a>!</p>
<h1>Thursday</h1>
<p>I have decided to try to start going back to the Thursday evening BodyPump class at my gym, so that is what I did. I don&#8217;t really like working out at night, but I do like the instructor for this particular class, and, despite being in the evening, it is late enough for me to make it after work most weeks.</p>

<p>After my workout, we watched the season finale of Suits, and then I folded a huge pile of laundry while catching up on some YouTube videos.</p>
<p>How was your week?</p>
