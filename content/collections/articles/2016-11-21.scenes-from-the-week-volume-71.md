<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>(1) Daniel and I managed to go to two weeknight concerts this week! We love going to concerts together, and Austin offers a ridiculous number of options. Tuesday&#8217;s concert was one of Daniel&#8217;s favorite new bands, Boxer Rebellion. It was at a little venue near my office. I had not listened to much of their music before, but I really enjoyed the show and have started listening to some of their songs at work.</p>
<p>(2) The second concert of the week was the one I was the most excited about. It was a joint concert by Relient K and Switchfoot. Relient K is Daniel&#8217;s favorite band from growing up, and we go see them any time they come play where we live. This was our third time seeing them since we were married, and it was Daniel&#8217;s tenth time to see them himself. They put on another great show. Switchfoot also gave a great performance. They ended their set playing &#8220;Dare You to Move&#8221;, one of my favorite songs ever (&#8220;A Walk to Remember&#8221; soundtrack, anyone??).</p>
<p>(3) Friday night through Saturday afternoon we got to puppy sit the cutest puppy named Tucker. Tucker was quite a handful, and <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/lazy-days-with-banana/" target="_blank">Banana</a> was not a fan, but it was fun to pretend to be puppy owners for a night!</p>
<p>(4) We decorated our apartment for Christmas on Sunday. We don&#8217;t usually decorate before Thanksgiving, but we are going to be traveling over Thanksgiving Weekend, and I&#8217;m turning right around and flying to Orlando the next Monday morning for a week-long work training. We decided to get the decorations out, so they are all set for the Christmas season after Thanksgiving. One very exciting thing for us this year is that we upgraded our Christmas tree! You may laugh when you see the picture because it&#8217;s still pretty small, but for the past five years, we have been using a little table-top tree I bought for my dorm room in college. We&#8217;ve always lived in small apartments, so we&#8217;ve been fine with the little tree, but I couldn&#8217;t resist getting a bigger one while we were walking around the Christmas section at Target on Saturday. We haven&#8217;t put the ornaments on the tree yet, but I&#8217;m so excited to do that Monday!</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>

<li>Meeting up with our friends Kaelin and Andres at a brewery to discuss our upcoming NYC trip together and going to see Dr. Strange right after that</li>
<li>Watching lots of Friends episodes. We are well into the third season!</li>
<li>Debating upgrading to a two-bedroom apartment but ultimately deciding we should stay in our one bedroom and save the money until we can buy a house</li>
<li>Running into my sister and her boyfriend randomly at Torchy&#8217;s on Saturday at 3pm</li>
</ul>

<li>I shared my <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2016/11/three-months-in-europe-packing-the-backpack/" target="_blank">packing list</a> for our (nearly) 3 month-long winter <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/tag/abernathy-adventure/" target="_blank">European adventure</a>. We packed in one backpack each, and I was very happy with my packing list. I really surprised myself because I&#8217;m not usually such a light packer!</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
