<p>I&#8217;m back from my trip to Galveston Island, Texas with my sisters. I had almost more airline delays than I could handle in this one little trip, but I had a blast with my sisters! Galveston is such a cute, historical island for exploring and relaxing &#8211; the perfect getaway for the holiday weekend.</p>
<p>This post has two parts: first, I am reporting my progress on my July goals (which isn&#8217;t much yet since I was traveling most of last week) in connection with the Weekly Wishes link-up hosted by <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a>, and second, I&#8217;m checking in with my Month 2 update for the <a href="http://megancstroup.blogspot.com/2014/04/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge.html" target="_blank">Semi-Charmed Summer 2014 Book Challenge</a>.</p>
<div style="width: 870px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" src="https://emilyabernathy.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/20140708-162506-59106770.jpg" alt="20140708-162506-59106770.jpg" width="860" height="860" /><p class="wp-caption-text">First time at the pool this summer &#8211; Galveston, July 5</p></div>
<h2>July Goals</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Read three books. </strong>This is the one goal I was able to work on while traveling. I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Keepers-Daughter-Novel/dp/0143037145" target="_blank">The Memory Keeper&#8217;s Daughter</a>, and I thought it was fantastic! I thought it was so good, in fact, that I rated it 5 stars on GoodReads &#8211; a rare thing for me to do.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Organize my jewelry. </strong>I have not done anything for this organizational project yet, but I have started getting ideas from different people.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Revamp my blog design and layout!! </strong>Daniel is out hiking the Appalachian Trail right now, but he comes back tomorrow. And, we are actually not traveling this weekend (for once!), so I think we may work on this then.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Write all of my posts about our Europe trip that I have planned&#8230; and post them! </strong>I&#8217;ve started my third and final post about our trip to London, and then I&#8217;ll do some posts on Paris. I think I can still have all of these completed by the end of the month.</p>
<p><strong>NEW GOAL: </strong></p>
<p>5. <strong>Explore <a href="http://www.skillshare.com" target="_blank">SkillShare</a> classes and start working on one. </strong>I want to be a life-long learner. To me this involves reading fiction and non-fiction, traveling, working on a language with my Duolingo app, watching documentaries, working on playing an instrument (for me, this would be piano, but I haven&#8217;t played in years), keeping up with current events, and taking classes just for the sake of learning. I&#8217;ve done a decent job of being a life-long learner in some of these areas, but I want to work on the areas I&#8217;m neglecting. Hopefully, signing up for SkillShare will help me to grow and work my brain! Do you have any class recommendations? I&#8217;m interested in so many different things, but I imagine I would want my first class to be related to developing my blog since that is currently my main hobby.</p>

<p>I have had a lot of fun doing this summer reading challenge! I&#8217;ve made okay progress this past month, but I&#8217;m still behind. I&#8217;m not going to get mad at myself if I don&#8217;t complete the challenge on time, but it is definitely still a big summer goal of mine!</p>
