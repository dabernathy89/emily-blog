<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.<a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SFTW_41.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6383" src="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SFTW_41-1024x1024.jpg" alt="SFTW_41" width="1024" height="1024" data-wp-pid="6383" srcset="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SFTW_41-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SFTW_41-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SFTW_41-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SFTW_41-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SFTW_41-800x800.jpg 800w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SFTW_41-630x630.jpg 630w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SFTW_41-600x600-cropped.jpg 600w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SFTW_41-1200x1200-cropped.jpg 1200w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SFTW_41.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>(1) Tuesday I got to go to Waco for a Baylor recruiting event put on by my company. I arrived in Waco a little bit early to see my parents, and we met at Heritage Creamery, right next door to the famous Common Grounds. I had never been there before since it wasn&#8217;t there when I went to Baylor. We loved it! I got a Salted Vanilla and Oranges &amp; Cream combo. Yum!</p>
<p>(2) My company&#8217;s Baylor recruiting event was a scavenger hunt at the Cameron Park Zoo. My group walked right by the lion exhibit whenever the male decided to roll around on his back just like a domestic cat! It was so cute. At this event I got to see several friends from college who I hadn&#8217;t seen in a long time. It was a fun night!</p>
<p>(3) Saturday night, we met our good friends Kim and Jordan for dinner at Kona Grill at the Domain in Austin. It was our first time to experience both the Domain and Kona Grill. Kona Grill is delicious, and we plan to be back for some more yummy sushi sometime. This is a picture of Kim and me taken while the four of us walked around the Domain after dinner.</p>
<p>(4) Sunday afternoon, Daniel and I went to a coffee shop to work and blog. I looked up from my table to see a print of Van Gogh&#8217;s <em>Cafe Terrace at Night</em> painting. All of the memories of our time in Arles, France and eating at this very restaurant came flooding back to me in that moment!</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are now obsessed with the TV show Broadchurch (thanks, Ellen!). It&#8217;s on Netflix, and we love it! If any of you have watched The Killing, the cinematography and storyline is very similar, but it is British and takes place in a small, coastal town in England.</li>
<li>Friday night I went with my sister Elizabeth to the Alamo Drafthouse (a movie theater here in Austin) for a Bridesmaids Quote-Along. I had actually never seen the movie before (I know, I know!), and it was fun to see it for the first time with a bunch of obsessed fans. Such a funny movie!</li>
<li>We have been going through our stack of gift cards that we rediscovered this week. We went to both Chick-fil-A and Maggiano&#8217;s on gift cards over the weekend. Yum!</li>
<li>Speaking of gift cards, we found some Amazon gift cards, and we had just enough for us to order some gym gear both of us have been wanting. Daniel needed some weight lifting gloves, and I wanted some spin shoes, so we placed an order. Yay for not having to rent shoes at the spin studios anymore!</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was a slow blogging week, but I did post <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2016/04/a-guide-to-eating-in-austin/" target="_blank">A Guide to Eating in Austin</a>! My husband put together this great map of our favorite restaurants with descriptions. It has already been helpful for several people planning trips to Austin!</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
