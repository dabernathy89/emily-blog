<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Month series!  In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous month ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have babies, everyday moments are extra special!</p>
<h2>Favorites from the Month:</h2>
<p><strong>Fiction Book</strong> &#8211; <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3iA21iP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Holdout</a> (Amazon affiliate link) </em>by Graham Moore. <i></i></p>
<p><strong>Nonfiction Book</strong> &#8211; None read in September.</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> &#8211; Taylor Swift&#8217;s<i> folklore </i>album and all of Ben Rector&#8217;s music</p>
<p><strong>Movie/TV</strong> &#8211; Season 2 of <i>Mindhunter</i></p>
<p><strong>Activity</strong> &#8211; Going on family walks in the evenings, now that the early evenings have cooled down here in Texas!</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishment</strong> &#8211; Sleep training our six-month-old. Caden now sleeps through the night (most of the time), yippee!</p>

September was my last full month of maternity leave. I soaked in every moment. Thankfully I still get to spend every Tuesday all day (in addition to weekends) with these two since I only work part-time.</p>
<p>(2) Carson got himself into a pickle&#8230;. He had a lot more fun pretending to be a baby in the sit-up chair than he did when we had to finangle him out of there!</p>
<p>(3) We got to go visit my cousin&#8217;s fire station when we went to DFW for the weekend. Carson had so much fun! You would have thought he was at Disney World by the look on his face.</p>
<p>(4) &#8220;Driving&#8221; the firetruck was the highlight of our fire station visit!</p>

Carson loved reading this book with Abuela.</p>
<p>(2) Happy Caden and Daddy on the car ride back to Fort Worth from a workday at my grandparents&#8217; house.</p>
<p>(3) Daniel and I got to get out for a date night this weekend! We loved Gemelle in Fort Worth. It had a great outdoor patio overlooking a beautiful garden and more outdoor seating.</p>
<p>(4) It was time to pull out our fall children&#8217;s book collection!</p>

<p>(2) This big boy in the the 90th percentile for weight and 100th for height!</p>
<p>(3) We started taking the boys to swim class again this month. This was Caden&#8217;s first class! He loved it.</p>
<p>(4) With the weather cooling down, we&#8217;ve pulled out some of Carson&#8217;s old fall baby clothes. Caden was excited to wear his first hoodie!</p>

It&#8217;s such a wonderful place to go right now &#8211; lots of outdoors space for Carson to run around and Caden to stretch out and play on a blanket. All with this beautiful Hill Country view!</p>
<p>(2) We did lots of crafts at home this month, thanks to our community&#8217;s wonderful event planner! Her team has put together several fun themed bags for kids. This week&#8217;s bag was bug-themed, so we made a cute bug jar!</p>
<p>(3) We love all the fun outdoor areas in our neighborhood! Carson particularly enjoys the &#8220;outside house&#8221;.</p>
<p>(4) This month we set up the activity center for Caden. He loves being on his legs and checking out the new toys!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SFTM_September-2020_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_5.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11595" src="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SFTM_September-2020_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_5.png" alt="SFTM_September 2020_EverydayAccountsBlog.com" width="940" height="788" data-wp-pid="11595" srcset="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SFTM_September-2020_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_5.png 940w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SFTM_September-2020_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_5-300x251.png 300w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SFTM_September-2020_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_5-768x644.png 768w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SFTM_September-2020_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_5-640x537.png 640w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SFTM_September-2020_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_5-752x630.png 752w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SFTM_September-2020_EverydayAccountsBlog.com_5-600x503.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></a>(1) As mentioned in my &#8220;accomplishment&#8221; section above, we moved Caden to his own room and officially sleep trained him this month! He&#8217;s so happy to be rested (and so are his parents!). And he loves his crib!</p>
<p>(2) We also pulled out the pumpkin jammies!</p>
<p>(3) Carson loved his green lollipop from the kids&#8217; haircut place.</p>
<p>(4) And last, but not least, the boys spent a weekend at Gramma and Grampa&#8217;s house in San Antonio. This was our first weekend away from Caden since he was born. The boys had so much fun, and Daniel and I got some rest, a dinner out, and lots of things done around the house. We sure did miss our babies though!</p>
