<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>
<p>This past week was so much fun! It contained three fun days: Mothers&#8217; Day, our six year anniversary, and my birthday. Usually we are on a trip at this time of year, but this year, we are taking fewer trips and decided to celebrate with a staycation. Friday Daniel surprised me with a full day of activities to celebrate my birthday which included a trip to the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, hand and foot massages, pizza at Pieous, a special tasting at The Infinite Monkey Theorem Winery, and a cooking class! He really went all out, and we had so much fun. Saturday was more of a low-key day &#8211; we did some shopping on S Congress and met up with friends for dinner at Grizzelda&#8217;s. Unfortuantely we didn&#8217;t get to go visit either of our mothers for Mothers&#8217; Day on Sunday, but we sent them our love in the form of gifts, cards, and phone calls. We celebrated our anniversary Sunday night with dinner at Clark&#8217;s Oyster Bar. Monday we drove out to Texas Wine Country and enjoyed the nice weather and slower pace. Monday night I flew to Dallas for a work training for the rest of the week.</p>

</a>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) It was a beautiful day on Friday at the Wildflower Center! It looked like we missed peak wildflower season by just a week or two, but there were still plenty of beautiful flowers to see, and the space itself is really nice. This view at the Center overlooking the Hill Country was just stunning!</p>
<p>(2) Infinite Monkey Theorem has such a cool vibe to it, but I&#8217;ve never been able to get a good photo since it&#8217;s usually fully of people. Friday afternoon, it was completely empty, so I snapped this photo after our tasting.</p>
<p>(3) In Friday&#8217;s cooking class, we made lobster rolls, crab cakes, and strawberry shortcake. It was delicious! It was also really fun to talk with the chef&#8217;s about their experiences and take note of their local foodie recommendations.</p>
<p>(4) At Sunday night&#8217;s anniversary dinner, we tried raw oysters for the first time. At Clark&#8217;s Oyster Bar, you select individual oysters by the place they come from. We know nothing about the different varieties of oysters, so we had the waitress pick for us. She gave us some from Massachusetts, some from California, and some from Canada. We are excited to say we are now oyster fans! I liked the ones from Massachusetts the best because they are larger and saltier. Yum!</p>
