<p>This morning, I left home (DC) for Atlanta on a 7am flight for a work meeting. Three hours ago I was already back home on my couch! Needless to say, it has been a long day of travel, so this will be short and sweet.</p>
<p>Each week, I link up with <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/2014/07/weekly-wishes-60/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to join the community of bloggers who share their goals for the week. I&#8217;m continuing to update my goals for the entire month of July rather than having a new set of goals each week. Right now, thinking about my to-dos in this big picture format has been working the best for me. <span style="color: #222222;">I&#8217;m considering changing the format up yet again sometime soon to give updates only twice a month because they are obviously repetitive, and I think reporting updates on the same goals four times a month is a bit excessive.</span></p>
<h2>July Goals</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Read three books. </strong>I finished up Mindy Kaling&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everyone-Hanging-Without-Other-Concerns/dp/0307886271/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406069377&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mindy+kaling" target="_blank">book</a> over the weekend. I just started<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Light-Between-Oceans-Novel/dp/1451681755/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406069481&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+light+between+oceans" target="_blank"> The Light Between Oceans</a> which is my third book of the month!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Organize my jewelry. </strong>Like I said last week, I have the tools I need, I just need to sit down and organize still. I think I will at least start tonight.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Revamp my blog design and layout!! </strong>This is done! You are looking at my new blog layout. My husband spent lots of time helping me get this set up and going. There are definitely still things that I am tweaking and fixing up, but I felt like it was good enough to make the official switch Sunday night.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Write all of my posts about our Europe trip that I have planned&#8230; and post them! </strong>I am so behind on this goal. My <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/travel-with-me/" target="_blank">Travel With Me</a> posts are some of my favorite to write, and I want them to be well-done which takes lots of time. I&#8217;m just going to write these posts as I have time to write them!</p>
<p>5. <strong>Explore <a href="http://www.skillshare.com" target="_blank">SkillShare</a> classes and start working on one. </strong>No progress to report for this goal, but it&#8217;s still on my mind!</p>
