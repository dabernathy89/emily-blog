<p>Twice a month I link up with <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to join the community of bloggers who share their goals for the week in the Weekly Wishes link-up. I&#8217;m continuing to update my goals for the entire month twice a month rather than having a new set of goals each week. Right now, thinking about my to-dos in this big picture format has been working the best for me.</p>
<p>I missed my mid-month check-in due to an insane work schedule at the beginning of the month. That probably means I did not meet many of my goals. Let&#8217;s see how I did, shall we?</p>
<h2>September Goals</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Make an <a href="http://www.artifactuprising.com/site/home" target="_blank">Artifact Uprising</a> book for our London/Paris trip from earlier this year. </strong>I have started the book, but I have not gotten very far.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Organize the cabinet under our kitchen sink. </strong>Done! Now I have easy access to all my cleaning supplies and our recycling bin area.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Make good progress on another SkillShare class. </strong>I&#8217;m terrible about making time for these classes. I need to figure this out because I want to make learning skills a priority in life.</p>
<p>4.<strong> Read two books. </strong>I read one book. Fail.</p>
<p>5.<strong> Decorate for Fall.</strong> My apartment is decorated for the season! You can take a glimpse of my decorations <a title="Happy Fall!" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/09/happy-fall/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2>October Goals</h2>
<p>Yay! It&#8217;s almost October! This is beginning of the best part of the year for me. Fall, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas. I love it all. What do I want to accomplish this month in the middle of all the fun?</p>
<p>1. <strong>Finish that <a href="http://www.artifactuprising.com/site/home" target="_blank">Artifact Uprising</a> book for our London &amp; Paris trip. </strong>I&#8217;m ready to have it as a pretty coffee table book!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Do a SkillShare class.</strong> Just do it!</p>
<p>3. <strong>Get back into reading regularly.</strong> I&#8217;ll aim for at least 30 minutes 5 days a week (not including audio book time).</p>
<p>4. <strong>Make the bed everyday.</strong> I used to be so good at this and then I started letting that good habit go. I want to get back into it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to a great October!</p>
