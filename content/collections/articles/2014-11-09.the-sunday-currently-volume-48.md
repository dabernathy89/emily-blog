<p>We just arrived at Chicago O&#8217;Hare, and we got here way too early. This TSA Pre-Check thing is going to take some getting used to! I definitely don&#8217;t need to be getting to the airport as early as I always have in the past.</p>
<p>Daniel and I had a great weeekend in Chicago! I&#8217;ll be sharing more on what we did later this week.</p>
<p><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></p>
<p><em>Reading  </em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Little-Lies-Liane-Moriarty/dp/0399167064/ref=la_B00459IA54_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414952222&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Big Little Lies</a>. I think it&#8217;s pretty good so far! I&#8217;m also going to flip through a Fast Company magazine on the plane.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>nothing really to note</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to all of the airport waiting area chit-chat. Airports are the best for people-watching (<em>and maybe a little eavesdropping</em>).</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I&#8217;m looking forward to sleeping in my own bed after a full week away</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> my Starbucks gingerbread latte</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to feel rested tomorrow morning even though we won&#8217;t be getting home until pretty late tonight</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>jeans and a long sleeved t-shirt and my favorite new cozy scarf (probably the same outfit as last Sunday actually)</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>Chicago! What a city! One of my friends described it as a mix of the best of NYC and the best of DC. I think that&#8217;s a fairly accurate description! It was a very, very cold weekend, but we will miss the city for sure.</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>a nice bowl of soup for dinner. I will have to search for one once I publish this post.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to get back into my daily devotionals. I plan to start diligently reading a <a href="http://www.shereadstruth.com/" target="_blank">She Reads Truth</a> study again this week.</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>very sleepy. Weekends away are awesome, but they are a sure way to be tired throughout the week.</p>
<p><em>Clicking </em>around on TripAdvisor again this week. We have yet another adventure next weekend!</p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
