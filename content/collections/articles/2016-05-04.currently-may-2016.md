<p><strong>Celebrating</strong> | Our fifth anniversary this month! I can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;ve been married for so long. It&#8217;s unbelievable. I still feel like a newlywed!</p>
<p><strong>Reading</strong> |<i> </i> I just started <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Alice Forgot</span>. I finished <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pretty Baby</span> by Mary Kubica (author of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Good Girl</span>, another great one!), and I thought it was a good! I&#8217;m also reading lots of travel blogs and magazines. I love reminiscing on the places we&#8217;ve been and building up my travel wishlist.</p>
<p><b>Pondering </b>| What is happening to our country? Some REALLY annoying political news just came out while I was writing this, and I&#8217;ve practically lost hope in the decision-making of Americans.</p>
<p><strong>Sipping </strong>| So much sparkling water! My favorite is the coconut La Croix, but I&#8217;ll really drink any of it.</p>
<p><strong>Going</strong> | To Fort Worth this weekend to celebrate Mothers&#8217; Day with Daniel&#8217;s parents and to DC for a friend&#8217;s wedding a couple weeks after that!</p>
<p><strong>Watching</strong> | Broadchurch, Season 2. Season 1 was so good! Go watch it on Netflix!</p>
<p><strong>Listening</strong> | To <span style="text-decoration: underline;">After You</span> on Audible. I&#8217;m almost done with it. I like it a lot, but I think that the first book (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Me Before You</span>) was better.</p>
