<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>(1) Saturday morning we decided we wanted to take advantage of the gorgeous Texas spring day and go for a hike. We are blessed to live right near many hiking trail options in the heart of the city. We didn&#8217;t really know where we were going, but getting lost and exploring was part of the fun! It really amazes me how blue the water is in parts of Lady Bird Lake.</p>
<p>(2) Saturday night we had a lovely early dinner at Eberly with Elizabeth and Jason. We shared a bunch of starters and pizza and had some great conversation!</p>
<p>(3) This weekend we also tried a new-to-us gelato place on S 1st, Dolce Neve, and it was delicious!</p>
<p>(4) Sunday I really wanted to take a photo with <a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2015/07/lazy-days-with-banana-08/" target="_blank">Banana</a>, but he wasn&#8217;t having it, so this is the best I&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking the plunge and getting a new member of the household, Ronnie the Roomba. Even though we live in a fairly small apartment, we just can&#8217;t keep up with vacuuming like we should with a cat who sheds a tremendous amount. I&#8217;m in love with Ronnie &#8211; he keeps our place so clean!</li>
<li>Finishing up two great shows, Bones and Big Little Lies. Both of the finales were very well-done. Bones has been a part of my life since Daniel and I had our first married summer six years ago. We used to watch regularly, but then we took a couple seasons off. When I heard they were ending the show, I decided to watch the final season, and Daniel joined me for the finale. The finale did a great job finalizing the story for all of the characters. My favorite parts were the shout out to Sweets, a favorite character who they killed off in a previous season, and a scene where Hodgins is going through old things and pulls out a photo of him and Zach from their Christmas at the Jeffersonian, an episode from the first season that I&#8217;ve always claimed as my favorite. I won&#8217;t go into the details of Big Little Lies as it&#8217;s a short seven-episode mini series, and I don&#8217;t want to give anything away, but the last episode is SO GOOD.</li>
<li>Getting Sunday breakfast tacos at the Veracruz food truck at Radio Coffee. These breakfast tacos are amazing! I would say we want this to be a Sunday tradition, but the one hour plus Sunday wait may make that not sustainable&#8230;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
