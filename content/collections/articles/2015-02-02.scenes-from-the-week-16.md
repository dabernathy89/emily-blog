<p>Happy Monday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these quick posts, I share the highlights from my week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events.</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong> was a good day because my sister Ellen came to Austin to stay with us for the week! She knew coming here that I probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to do much with her since I&#8217;m in busy season at work, but we had a good time in the evenings, and she explored the city on her own during the day.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> after work Ellen and I watched the latest episode of The Bachelor together. We had a good time making fun of the ridiculousness that was that episode&#8230;.</p>
<p>On <strong>Wednesday</strong> morning, I woke up to Banana all cuddled up on the floor next to the bed&#8230;..</p>

<p>That evening Ellen, Daniel, and I met up with my sister Elizabeth and her boyfriend for our first Matt&#8217;s Famous El Rancho experience! This is an Austin Tex-Mex classic that we&#8217;ve been told to try out over and over again. Just like everyone said it would be, the Bob Armstrong dip was so, so good (queso with ground beef and guacamole), and everyone loved their enchiladas and fajitas.</p>
<p>Elizabeth came over for a quick dinner on <strong>Thursday</strong>.</p>
<p>My sisters, Daniel, Jason, and I all got together again on <strong>Friday</strong> for burgers and celebration of the weekend!</p>

<p>Both <strong>Saturday</strong> and <strong>Sunday</strong> were lazy days at home &#8211; much needed after working the past two weekends in a row. Ellen took the train back home Saturday morning. I did get a lot of cleaning/organizing done, but there was plenty of lounging, catching up on shows, and staying in pajamas. Sunday I started feeling really sick in the morning&#8230;. We hosted a Super Bowl party in our apartment&#8217;s media room Sunday night, but I was unable to join because of my sickness. 🙁 So, that was a big bummer. My husband made taco cupcakes (pictured below) for the party, and they were a big hit!</p>

<p>Some of you may have noticed that I have not been consistently blogging lately. This makes me very sad as I was motivated to consistently post throughout the year at the beginning of 2015.  Well, my job at my new office has required quite a bit more hours up front than I had expected, so I did not prepare in advance well enough. I&#8217;m going to try to blog more than I have the past couple weeks (which was not at all), but I&#8217;m also going to cut myself some slack if I don&#8217;t reach my goals. Blogging with a busy career is tough, but I don&#8217;t plan on stopping any time soon. 🙂</p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
