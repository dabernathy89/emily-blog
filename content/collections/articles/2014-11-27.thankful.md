<p>Today I am <strong>thankful</strong> to be in a cozy cabin in the gorgeous mountains of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia with my family who traveled all the way up here to spend time with us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m <strong>thankful</strong> for a husband who has been with me every step of the way for the past three years of marriage and even before that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m <strong>thankful</strong> for the warm, delicious meal we will eat later today.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m <strong>thankful</strong> for books and movies and stories that teach us and entertain us throughout our lives.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m <strong>thankful</strong> that all of our plans to move to Austin are becoming a reality very soon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m <strong>thankful</strong> for a Savior who has forgiven me and who is teaching me how to live a life that is for Him and not for myself.</p>
<p><em>Have a very happy Thanksgiving!</em></p>
