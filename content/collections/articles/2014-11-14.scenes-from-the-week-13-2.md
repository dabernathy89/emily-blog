<p>Happy Friday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these quick posts I share the highlights from my week &#8211; ranging from memorable events to the small things that made me smile.</p>
<p>This week was a busy one! We arrived home from <a title="Travel with Me (Briefly) // Chicago" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/11/travel-with-me-briefly-chicago/" target="_blank">Chicago</a> really late on Sunday night which meant we got no grocery shopping or chores done over the weekend. This always throws me off, but we make it work.</p>

The bright blue skies made it look like a beautiful day, but it was actually freezing outside!</p></div>
<p>After work on <strong>Monday</strong>, I went to happy hour at On the Border with some friends. <strong>Tuesday</strong> I joined Daniel and a group from a conference he attended this week at the IMAX movie theater to see Interstellar. I thought the movie was fantastic! Very well-made, beautiful cinematography, impressive acting (especially Matthew McConaughey!), and epic music.</p>
<p>The <strong>next day</strong> I caught up with my best friend from high school over the phone. I has been WAY too long since we&#8217;ve talked &#8211; I&#8217;m a terrible phone person. After getting off the phone, I used one of my new holiday bath bombs from LUSH and soaked in the tub. <strong>Thursday</strong> I got some really exciting news that I&#8217;ll share on the blog here very soon! I ended the day with a cup of coffee at Starbucks with Kaitlin. (P.S. The new Starbucks Chesnut Praline latte is delicious!).</p>
<p>Have a great weekend!</p>
