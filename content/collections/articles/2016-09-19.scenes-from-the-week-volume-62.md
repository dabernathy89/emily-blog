<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

After ending busy season on Thursday, we had weekend plans to just relax, eat good food, and not do a whole lot. I think we were successful!</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) As an &#8220;end-of-busy season&#8221; celebration (we will take any excuse to celebrate!), we tried a new restaurant, Emmer &amp; Rye. It was excellent! We decided that it ties for first place in our rankings of best restaurants in Austin (next to Launderette, where we celebrated our five year anniversary).</p>
<p>(2) I was short on pictures from this weekend, so Emmer &amp; Rye gets two this week. The restaurant serves small plates, and this was our carnitas course. So yummy!</p>
<p>(3) Saturday we went out for Cuban food. Cuban sandwiches, black beans, and rice make for a great lunch!</p>
<p>(4) Slow weekends at home just wouldn&#8217;t be complete without a visit to our favorite local coffee shop. 🙂</p>
<p>Not Pictured:</p>
<ul>
<li>My sister had a house warming party Saturday night that we stopped by. Her new place looks great, and it was fun to see some of her friends again.</li>
<li>I got lots of sleeping and reading done.</li>
<li>After going to the pool one last time, we kissed summer goodbye and then put out a few fall decorations (even though I&#8217;m convinced this was one of the hottest Texas weekends of the summer&#8230;).</li>
<li>I had an phone upgrade to redeem, so I got the new iPhone 7 on Saturday. I&#8217;m not one to get super excited about phones, but the new one sure is pretty, and I&#8217;m excited to have a better camera!</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>As this was the last week of busy season at work, I didn&#8217;t get another post written for my blog. 🙁</li>
<li>But I&#8217;m guest posting on one of my favorite blogs today &#8211; <a href="http://www.wanderingweekenders.com/" target="_blank">The Wandering Weekenders</a>! Check out my post on 8 Things to Do with One Day in Venice <a href="http://www.wanderingweekenders.com/2016/09/19/8-things-one-day-venice/" target="_blank">here.</a></li>
