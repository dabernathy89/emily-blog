<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Month series!  In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous month ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have babies, everyday moments are extra special!</p>
<p>In typical 2020 fashion, I have ended the year with health issues. Six weeks ago, I woke up dizzy, and I&#8217;ve been that way ever since. I&#8217;ve been to lots of doctors, gotten lots of scans, and we still aren&#8217;t sure what the issue is. It&#8217;s been really tough on all of us as a family since I can&#8217;t help with the babies nearly as much. The days have been long, but there have still been many good moments that I am happy to document here.</p>
<p>October and November are two of my three favorite months of the year, so I have lots of photos to share. As usual, most of them are of my babies. Since I cannot look at a computer for long, and it has already taken me a couple weeks to get this post together, I am going to share mostly photos with few words this time around.</p>
<h2>Favorites from the Month(s):</h2>
<p><strong>Fiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/3qKtp2M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>One by One</em></a> by Ruth Ware and <a href="https://amzn.to/2Kf5bNe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>American Royals</em></a> by Katharine McGee</p>
<p><strong>Nonfiction Book</strong> &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/377enw9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Becoming</em></a> by Michelle Obama and <a href="https://amzn.to/3m9vm5c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Finding Freedom</em></a> by Omid Scobie</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> &#8211; I always start listening to Christmas music on November 1st. My favorites in November were Jon McLaughlin&#8217;s<a href="https://amzn.to/3n76qNj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i> Christmas Time </i></a>album and the Christmas Choral classics station on Pandora</p>
<p><strong>Movie/TV</strong> &#8211; Dublin Murders (Starz) and Dash &amp; Lily (Netflix)</p>
<p><strong>Activity</strong> &#8211; Caden&#8217;s first Halloween!</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishment</strong> &#8211; Getting family photos done. Honestly, getting the outfits planned, everyone ready, doing my own hair and makeup, packing up two children, and driving 40 minutes to the location on an early Sunday morning photo shoot feels like a huge win in my book!</p>
