<p><em><strong>Gathering</strong></em> | Junk out of our closets. My husband moved us into a new apartment all on his own while I was at a work conference, and it was a very last-minute decision, so we had no time to do a pre-move clean out as usual. I&#8217;m using the opportunity to get rid of junk and clutter as I go through our things and get the new place organized.</p>
<p><em><strong>Making</strong></em> |<i> </i>Travel photo books. Well, at least I&#8217;m going to be soon! Last year I made a couple books for some past trips (our (first) <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/06/travel-with-me-london-what-we-did/" target="_blank">London</a> + <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/08/travel-with-me-paris-what-we-did/" target="_blank">Paris </a>trip and our <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/tag/peru/" target="_blank">Peru</a> trip) on <a href="http://www.artifactuprising.com" target="_blank">Artifact Uprising</a>, and I want to continue making them for the trips we have taken since then! They are so fun to flip through and easier to share with a friend than a blog post or my photos on my computer.</p>
<p><b><em>Sipping</em> </b>| Coffee, tea, water, and sparkling water only. My husband and I are doing Whole30 this month which doesn&#8217;t allow for a wide variety of drink options. Whole30 is going well so far, but it&#8217;s only Day 3! On another note, I&#8217;ve been really enjoying making coffee pour overs at home on my days off. My brother-in-law gave me some coffee beans from one of my favorite coffee roasters, so it has inspired to work on learning the best way of manually brewing coffee.</p>
<p><strong><em>Following</em> </strong>| A couple new fun blogs I&#8217;ve found. I really don&#8217;t need to add to my already huge Bloglovin&#8217; subscription feed, but I have found some great new reads lately.</p>
<p><em><strong>Resolving</strong></em> | To do many things in 2017, which I&#8217;ll probably post more detail about next week. My New Years resolutions primarily focus on health (#original), the blog, and creating routines that work for me.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reading</strong></em> | <a href="http://amzn.to/2jKewKG" target="_blank">Tiny Little Thing</a> by Beatriz Williams. You guys, I LOVE this author. Her books are so interesting and well-written. After this, I will have read all of her books except for one, and I&#8217;ll be reading that one shortly. Hopefully she is working on more books!</p>

<p><i>{Thanks for reading! Want to know a little more about me? I’m a CPA learning how to balance a career with frequent travel while planting roots at home in Austin, TX.
