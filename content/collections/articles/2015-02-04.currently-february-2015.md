<p><strong>Hearting</strong> | The month of February because it&#8217;s birthday month for my husband (and his twin brother), my grandpa, my dad, one of my best friends, and the month of Valentines&#8217; Day! I always have fun focusing on celebrating so many people I love during this month.</p>
<p><strong>Pinning</strong> |<i> </i>I&#8217;m honestly not a big &#8220;pinner&#8221;. I love looking at pins, but I&#8217;m not great at keeping up with my own Pinterest boards. That&#8217;s actually something I&#8217;m hoping to pick up soon. I&#8217;ve been looking at a lot of home decor inspiration and travel ideas, so I might as well pin what I find, right?</p>
<p><strong>Eating</strong> | A little healthier during the week and going all out with the great food Austin has to offer over the weekend. I&#8217;m trying to have salads and fruit for lunch and homemade dinners filled with veggies during the week, so that I can eat Tex-Mex and pancakes over the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipating</strong> | The end of busy season. 🙂 In this career, I always find myself wishing away busy season, but I really don&#8217;t want to do that because it means wishing away a lot of my life&#8230;.. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m trying to work on.</p>
<p><strong>Reading</strong> | <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-She-Does-It-everywomans-ebook/dp/B00JDYCY80" target="_blank">How She Does It </a>by Anne Bogel, one of my favorite bloggers! She blogs over at <a href="http://modernmrsdarcy.com/" target="_blank">Modern Mrs. Darcy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Listening</strong> | To the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outlander-Diana-Gabaldon/dp/0440212561" target="_blank">Outlander</a> audio book. I&#8217;m going to be listening to this for a while (it&#8217;s 33 hours of content for just one book, and my commute is only 15 minutes).</p>
<p><strong>Dreaming</strong> | Of <a title="Travel With Me // Paris – What We Did" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/08/travel-with-me-paris-what-we-did/" target="_blank">our time in Paris</a>. We loved that city and hope to go back in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking</strong> | These <a href="http://www.the-girl-who-ate-everything.com/2012/04/double-decker-taco-cupcakes.html#HRPfWt8dHA8bZzcv.32" target="_blank">taco cupcakes</a>. Well, I didn&#8217;t cook them, but my husband did for our Superbowl party, and I wanted to share because they were fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>Drinking</strong> | Trader Joe&#8217;s Very Green juice a few times a week. It&#8217;s so delicious, and I feel really healthy when I drink it!</p>
