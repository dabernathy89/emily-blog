<p>If you are either an avid blog reader or a frequent traveler who likes to plan ahead, you are probably well-aware of the tremendous amount of travel-related resources you can find through the blogging community. <a href="http://www.gpsmycity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPSMyCity</a> is a company that has recognized the value and volume of these resources and has created an app that allows you to pick your favorite travel articles or travel blog posts and save them offline to your phone for free. The most useful and innovative feature of the app, however, is that GPSMyCity has created an accompanying interactive map for each article in their app. For a $1.99 upgrade, you have access to these offline GPS-powered guides for every travel article you&#8217;ve saved. As of now, they have over 6,500 walks mapped out in over 1,000 cities, all available for downloading onto an app right now.</p>
<p>Often when my husband and I travel out of the country, we often choose to go without cell phone service and data rather than pay for an international plan or use a local phone. In those situations, having offline access to the articles you want to pull travel ideas and details from can be really useful. Additionally, I know I like to do some last-minute research on the plane before I arrive somewhere, so being able to save articles for plane research is also valuable since I rarely want to pay for WiFi on the plane. With GPSMyCity apps, you can have offline access to your favorite travel articles and blog posts for free. And, for $1.99 you are able to upgrade any article to be GPS-guided, meaning you will will access to a map that will show you and guide you to all of the sites and locations that the article references, all without using phone data. The app is also able to track where you&#8217;ve already walked in the city which can be really useful for orienting yourself to a new destination.</p>
<p>GPSMyCity has added several of my blog posts as downloadable guides. Recently, they have added the following two guides:</p>
<div><b>Travel with Me and Baby | Chicago</b> &#8211; <a href="https://www.gpsmycity.com/blog/6359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gpsmycity.com/blog/6359&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1580582069946000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH1mE2McHQv-BFrOwFTq-RKfHRjUw">https://www.<wbr />gpsmycity.com/blog/6359</a></div>
<div><b>Travel with Me and Baby | Nashville</b> &#8211; <a href="https://www.gpsmycity.com/blog/6358" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gpsmycity.com/blog/6358&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1580582069946000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH1neRFy6uVcvWiv_r7BiMokYKONw">https://www.<wbr />gpsmycity.com/blog/6358</a></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of these posts is available to be upgraded for free for one week after today (until Monday, February 10, 2020) &#8211; my <a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2019/08/travel-with-me-chicago-babys-first-flight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago &#8211; Travel With Me &amp; Baby</a> guide. If you are planning to travel to Chicago (with or without a baby!), I suggest taking advantage of the free upgrade right now! Just click on the link and it will direct you to a page where you can download and upgrade this guide (once you&#8217;ve already downloaded the app), or you can search for it in the app once you&#8217;ve downloaded it. I&#8217;ve noticed that on iPhone, the link will always direct you to the app store, even if you have already downloaded the app, so I recommend just searching in the app. The company has told me that this is an iPhone limitation.</p>
