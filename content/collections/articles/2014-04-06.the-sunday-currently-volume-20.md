<p>The picture above was taken by my husband right outside of our apartment. The cherry blossoms have come to the DC area, and they are so beautiful!</p>
<p>It has been quite a busy weekend (for both work and fun reasons), so I&#8217;m really enjoying slowing down and sitting here at Barnes and Noble doing some reading and trip planning. Spending Sunday afternoons in either a bookstore or a coffee shop has become a weekly tradition for us. Actually, before my work hours got longer, we usually did this twice a week. It gives us a chance to get away from the TV screen to talk, read, write, or even get some work done in our favorite environment.</p>
<p>Friday night we took it easy: we walked over to a favorite cafe of ours for dinner and rented a movie from Redbox. Saturday I worked and did taxes while Daniel updated our car registration and inspection. Later, after running more errands, we went out to celebrate a friend&#8217;s birthday, and then Daniel convinced me to see the new Captain America, so we did. I&#8217;m not sure why I wasn&#8217;t that interested in this one &#8211; I just felt like I wouldn&#8217;t really enjoy it, and I was right. I thought it was kind of boring, but Daniel loved it.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Cuckoos-Calling-Robert-Galbraith/dp/0316206849" target="_blank">The Cuckoo&#8217;s Calling</a>. Slowly but surely!</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>in my planner. I have not done a lot of planner updating lately, but that&#8217;s probably because I have not had a lot to plan. That will all change after 4/15!! 😀</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to the many background conversations of the people sitting around me.  Lots of people come here on Sunday afternoons, and it&#8217;s usually a race to get a table.</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>that I need to remember what I wrote in <a title="The Busy Days" href="https://everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/03/14/the-busy-days/" target="_blank">this post</a> and stop wallowing in self-pity about stupid things when I am so blessed</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  coffee and books. The best smell!</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> I didn&#8217;t have a huge tax bill to deal with</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to read quite a bit of my book (see <em>Reading</em> above) today because I can&#8217;t seem to make much time during the weekdays for reading anymore</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>jeans and a t-shirt</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> seeing so many people sitting and enjoying their books and magazines and conversations this Sunday afternoon</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>coffee! Believe it or not, I haven&#8217;t had any yet this morning, and the coffee I ordered here is still too hot to drink</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to book our plane tickets to Texas in June for our good friend&#8217;s wedding!<br />
