<p>All day Friday through Saturday afternoon, Daniel and I were at our church for <a href="http://fairfax.cc/blue/" target="_blank">The Blue Conference</a>. This fantastic conference focused on faith in the workplace and using your vocation as your way of contributing to God&#8217;s work on earth. It was fascinating. I&#8217;ll be writing a post of the the incredible line up of speakers and the highlights from the event soon.</p>
<p>The conference was definitely the highlight of the week. I had an very hard few days at work physically and emotionally. Part of it was because I had to work harder Monday through Thursday so that I could take off Friday, but there were many other factors that made it completely draining. As a result, I missed my main post of the week (which usually goes up Thursday or Friday). I definitely don&#8217;t want this to become a habit, but I can&#8217;t be too hard on myself. April 15th (the end of the busiest time of the year for me) cannot get here fast enough.</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Cuckoos-Calling-Robert-Galbraith/dp/0316206849" target="_blank">The Cuckoo&#8217;s Calling</a>. I&#8217;m not far (read paragraph above), but I&#8217;m definitely drawn into the story!</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>my main post for this week in order to avoid having to miss it again</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to Grey&#8217;s Anatomy. Catching up on a couple shows on this rainy morning.</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>about how grateful I am for a much-needed slow Sunday morning even if I do have a lot of work to get through this afternoon</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  my coffee</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> for April 16th!</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>for a productive afternoon that will make Monday a little easier</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>pajamas</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> that I can check off cleaning the apartment on my weekend to-do list</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to wake up! I&#8217;m feeling very groggy this morning.</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> to get outside today, even if it&#8217;s raining<br />

<p><em>Feeling</em>  slow and groggy</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>Bloglovin&#8217; and a couple of restaurant reviews of potential anniversary dinner spots in Paris<a href="https://twitter.com/siddathornton"><br />

<p>Enjoy your day!</p>
