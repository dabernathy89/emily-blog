<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

Yes, it represents a very busy time at work, but I get to step away from all of that a little bit just to celebrate my husband during this week. His birthday is February 13, the day before Valentine&#8217;s Day. I always try to celebrate his birthday separately from Valentine&#8217;s Day, so it ends up being a week full of celebration.</p>
<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Daniel&#8217;s birthday was Monday. We started the day with a Cinnabon &#8211; Daniel&#8217;s request! After work we headed out for BBQ and drinks. I had a bigger surprise for him the following weekend &#8211; a getaway in the hill country! I gave him some of the details on the upcoming weekend on his birthday but kept most of the details from him until later in that week so that it could be a surprise.</p>
<p>(2) We didn&#8217;t ever get around to grocery shopping this week which meant I had my pick of lunch options at work this week. One of my favorites is an acai bowl from Blenders &amp; Bowls. I&#8217;ve featured one on the blog before, but I just had to share it again! It was so beautiful and tasty!</p>
<p>(3) Thursday night we headed out to the Hill Country for Daniel&#8217;s birthday weekend! We stayed in a <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/577410" target="_blank">retro Airstream</a> I rented on Airbnb, went ziplining (with Wimberley Zipline Adventures &#8211; amazing!), visited some local shops and breweries, and enjoyed some wonderful meals. I&#8217;d say it was a success!</p>
<p>(4) One of our favorite parts of the Airbnb was the hammock outside of the Airstream. This weather this weekend was absolutely beautiful and perfect for lounging outside.</p>

<li>A girls&#8217; dinner out with my friends Caitlyn and Jennifer at Flower Child</li>
<li>Valentine&#8217;s dinner at Eberly, one of the best new restaurants in town. We usually like to enjoy Valentine&#8217;s Day dinner at home, but we can walk to Eberly and had a reservation, so it was an easy dinner out. We had been waiting for a special occasion to go to this restaurant, and it was the perfect opportunity! The cheese and charcuterie board was amazing and our main dishes (lemon gnocchi and wild boar!) were delicious. I recommend the restaurant both for the food and for the swanky environment.</li>
<li>Finalizing the guest bedroom/office in our apartment. We got home from the Hill Country mid-day Saturday and got to work on cleaning up the bedroom. We still have some frames to purchase to finalize the decorations (a travel theme, of course!), but it is mostly done and organized!</li>
<li>Visiting our friends Jordan and Kim in their new house in Round Rock. It&#8217;s a beautiful home! We enjoyed catching up with our friends, seeing the new home, and getting a glimpse of the nursery for their baby girl who will be born this year!</li>

<p>Have a great week!</p>
