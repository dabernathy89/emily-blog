Twice a month I link up with <a href="http://www.thenectarcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Nectar Collective</a> to join the community of bloggers who share their goals for the week in the Weekly Wishes link-up. I&#8217;m continuing to update my goals for the entire month twice a month rather than having a new set of goals each week. Right now, thinking about my to-dos in this big picture format has been working the best for me.</p>
<p>I missed the November mid-month check in for various reasons, but I wanted to see how I did with my goals even though I didn&#8217;t pay much attention to them throughout the month.</p>
<p>First, I will go through how I did on my November goals, and then I will share what I hope to accomplish in December.</p>
<h2>November Goals</h2>
<p>1. <strong>With all of our travel, remember to take lots of pictures to share on the blog and use in my Project Life album. </strong>Oh, I have plenty of pictures from the month!!</p>
<p>2. <strong>Make a pumpkin pie. </strong>I made one for Thanksgiving! Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of it, but I think it turned out really well! I like to use a graham cracker crust &#8211; delicious!</p>
<p>3. <strong>Don&#8217;t put off my travel posts this month. </strong>I was able to post about each of our November trips the week after we returned from them!</p>
<p>4.<strong> In addition to audio books, read two books.</strong> Yep! I listened to one audio book and read two books this month.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Use the Day One app every day.</strong> FAIL! I got behind and kind of gave up, but I&#8217;d like to try it again.</p>
<h2>December Goals</h2>
<p>1. <strong>Be 90% packed for our cross-country move by  December 13th.</strong> The moving crates come on the 15th, but I&#8217;d love to be able to mostly just focus on spending time with friends on the 14th.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Find an apartment in Austin.</strong> We are meeting with a realtor on the 21st to look at apartments, and we would love to move in by the 30th or 31st . It&#8217;s going to be a quick decision!</p>
<p>3. <strong>Develop goals and ideas for 2015.</strong> It may be strange for me to have a goal to make goals, but I am really looking forward to living in a new city, working in a new office, and making new friends, and I would like to &#8220;refresh&#8221; several other areas of my life during this period of change. The New Year is the perfect time to do this.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for this month! I am keeping it simple so that I can focus on the move and be able to just enjoy the holiday season with any spare time I have.</p>
