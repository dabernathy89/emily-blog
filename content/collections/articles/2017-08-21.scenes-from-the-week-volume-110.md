<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>Photos from the week, top left to bottom right:</p>
<p>(1) Friday Daniel and I were able to take longer lunch breaks, so we met for a meal. We went to the new Caroline&#8217;s restaurant in downtown Austin, and I had the most delicious brussels sprout salad with salmon. Yum!</p>
<p>(2) My brother is a student at Baylor, and he lives in the same residence hall that Daniel and I lived in. He is really involved in the leadership at the residence hall, and he found this fun collage in the storage closet last week! You can&#8217;t see it without zooming in, but there are several photos of Daniel and me and many of our friends in here. Daniel talked me out of keeping and storing it (<em>my voice of reason!</em>), but I&#8217;m happy to have a photo of all of these great memories. 🙂</p>
<p>(3) Sunday morning we decided to go to the late service at church, so we had time to get a brunch plate to share at one of our favorite local coffee shops, Patika. We stayed there a couple hours to get some work things done (blogging for me, freelance project for Daniel) before heading over to church.</p>
<p>(4) For lunch on Sunday we went to a new-to-us local Indian restaurant, New India, where I had a delicious chicken tikka masala.</p>

<li>Happy hour with Kelsey (author of the <a href="http://www.somuchlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">So Much Life blog</a>) at ATX Cocina. I definitely enjoyed happy hour there more than dinner (which I had tried <a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2017/08/scenes-from-the-week-volume-109/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a>). Kelsey and I had a great time hanging out and getting to know each other. (P.S. You should go check out <a href="http://www.somuchlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her blog</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s one of my favorite lifestyle blogs!).</li>
<li>We finished Downton Abbey this week. I cried as it ended! In my opinion, everything ended perfectly. I have mixed feelings on the upcoming movie &#8211; I&#8217;m so excited to get to &#8220;hang out&#8221; with the characters again, but I&#8217;m also a little terrified that they are going to ruin it&#8230;. To be determined, I guess.</li>
<li>Meeting some friends at Craftsman for their Cuban Style Pig Roast on Saturday. The pork, grilled plantain, and side salad were all delicious. We had a good time eating this unique meal while catching up with our friends. Austin has lots of fun events like this all the time, and we don&#8217;t go to nearly enough of them.</li>
<li>Gearing up for our trip to Montreal this week, and we cannot wait to escape this heat for a few days. We are keeping this trip pretty low-key and haven&#8217;t planned much. We&#8217;ve already booked a food tour (of course!), but we picture ourselves mostly just wandering the different neighborhoods, popping into a restaurant, bookstore, or museum here and there, and enjoying the cool weather. If you have any recommendations for Montreal, leave them in the comments below or send me an email!</li>
<li>Getting some good, encouraging news at work. I never would have thought I&#8217;d still be working for a Big 4 accounting firm nearly six years after starting there, but here I am! It still feels like the right fit for me, at least for now.</li>
<li>Running some errands on Saturday, including going to the mall for our bi-annual wedding ring inspections and Target for home essentials</li>
</ul>

<li>I share about <a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2017/08/travel-with-me-7-things-to-do-in-siena-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7 things to do</a> in one of my favorite cities in Italy, <a href="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2017/08/travel-with-me-7-things-to-do-in-siena-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siena</a>! Siena was a big surprise for us. We loved every moment of our time in this beautiful, peaceful, and historical Tuscan hill town.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
