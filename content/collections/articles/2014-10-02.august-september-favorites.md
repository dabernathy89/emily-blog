<p>I&#8217;m back with another update on my favorites from the month, but this time I&#8217;m covering my favorites from the past two months. I missed posting about my August favorites because of a crazy work schedule in the beginning of September, but I wanted to be sure to share some of those things on the blog. Better late than never!</p>
<h2>Movie</h2>
<h3> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435651/" target="_blank">The Giver</a></h3>
<p>We didn&#8217;t watch very many movies this month, but I really enjoyed The Giver! I thought that the acting was great, and I liked the story line. I never did read the book, so I can&#8217;t compare the two. It was a fun summer movie to see!</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p><strong>Maroon 5</strong></p>
<p>I have been on a huge Maroon 5 kick lately. I don&#8217;t know what started it. I bought their new CD (<em>V</em>), but I have been obsessing over their old music &#8211; not the new stuff. Their <em>Songs About Jane</em> album is basically the soundtrack to my high school years, and I listened to <em>It Won&#8217;t Be Soon Before Too Long</em> for a good chunk of college. They both bring back a lot of fun memories, and I just love their old sound. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Cti12XBw4" target="_blank">Sunday Morning</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIjVuRTm-dc" target="_blank">She Will Be Loved</a> are my absolute favorites.</p>
<h2>Paper Products</h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.treat.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Treat</a></strong></p>
<p>I was contacted by <a href="http://www.treat.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Treat</a>, a custom card company created by the Shutterfly brand, to see if I would be interested in trying out their card service. I was excited to be given this opportunity because I had actually already planned to send out two cards in August &#8211; a thank you card to Daniel&#8217;s Grandma for hosting us in Florida in August and a &#8220;just because&#8221; card to one of my best friends. I love sending and receiving snail mail, and I&#8217;m trying to send more and more.</p>

<p>Aren&#8217;t the cards cute?</p>
<p>I had a great experience with Treat. The online card &#8220;building&#8221; process was simple &#8211; there were many cute designs to choose from, and I was able to easily pull in my own images and customized text. While placing the order for my two cards, I requested that they send the cards to me so that I could look at them and take these pictures. I also requested that they stamp the pre-addressed envelopes for me. Both of these things made the card-sending process very convenient. I definitely plan to use their services in the future. Daniel and I are thinking about hosting a little party around Halloween, so we are considering using Treat to order invitations. They have some very cute <a href="http://www.treat.com/search/fall" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">fall</a> and <a href="http://www.treat.com/shop/halloween-cards.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Halloween</a> designs to choose from!</p>
<h2>Food/Drink</h2>
<p><strong>Dunkin&#8217; Donuts Cinnamon Coffee Roll Coffee</strong></p>
<p>Apparently I have a thing for cinnamon coffee because I featured some delicious cinnamon k-cups in my <a title="July Favorites" href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/07/july-favorites/" target="_blank">July favorites post</a> as well. But this coffee is so good!</p>
<p><strong>White Chocolate Kit-Kat Bars &amp; White Chocolate Reese&#8217;s Cups</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BIRU-WP-251.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3473 aligncenter" src="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BIRU-WP-251-1024x768.jpeg" alt="BIRU-WP-251.jpeg" width="719" height="539" srcset="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BIRU-WP-251-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BIRU-WP-251-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BIRU-WP-251.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" /></a></p>
<p>Fun fact: I hate chocolate. I&#8217;m not allergic; I just really don&#8217;t like the taste. Part of me always felt like I have been missing out on something great by not liking chocolate like the rest of the world. When I discovered these white chocolate options (yes, I do like white chocolate, but I&#8217;m told it doesn&#8217;t count), I immediately had to try them. Finally, I have a peanut-butter filled option that I enjoy! I love both of these &#8211; especially the Reese&#8217;s Cups, and I hope to snag some more soon this fall!</p>
<h2>Beauty/Skincare</h2>

<p><strong>Organix Coconut Milk Shampoo and Conditioner</strong></p>
<p>I found these on sale at CVS in August (buy one, get one free), so I decided to give them a shot. The smell is heavenly! While the scent is more suitable for the summer seasons, I think I will be re-purchasing it throughout the fall. My hair feels so soft when I use it, and I can smell the creamy coconut scent on it for a couple of days (I only wash my hair twice a week).</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.bathandbodyworks.com/product/index.jsp?productId=41813806&amp;cp=12586965.12587143.4191851" target="_blank">Bath &amp; Body Works Pumpkin Latte &amp; Marshmallow Comfort Fragrance Mist</a></strong></p>
<p>This stuff is SO GOOD. I was a little bit hesitant to order it online because I didn&#8217;t know if I wanted to smell like a marshmallow pumpkin. The reviews were so great online that I couldn&#8217;t resist. When I got it in the mail and smelled it for the first time, I was in love! It smells more like a musky vanilla to me, and I think it is the perfect fall scent. I get happy every morning when I put it on.</p>
<h2>Current Events</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.theskimm.com/" target="_blank">theSkimm</a></h3>
<p>There was a time in my life that I loved to read and watch the news. For a couple of years now, I have not kept up very well with current events at all, and I got really tired of never being able to contribute to conversations about what was going on in the world. Recently, I discovered theSkimm, and I feel very well-informed now! theSkimm sends you an email in the mornings five days a week with a summary of current events from the day before. I&#8217;m not really sure how they fit everything in, but they cover all of the important things that are happening internationally and in the US. The emails are a perfect length, so I&#8217;m able to read it before I start each work day in five minutes or less. If you want to keep up with current events but get overwhelmed by news websites, I definitely recommend this resource. It has made a huge difference for me.</p>
<p>What are you loving these days?</p>
