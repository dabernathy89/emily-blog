<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.<a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SFTW_51.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7004" src="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SFTW_51-1024x1024.jpg" alt="SFTW_51" width="1024" height="1024" data-wp-pid="7004" srcset="https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SFTW_51-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SFTW_51-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SFTW_51-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SFTW_51-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SFTW_51-800x800.jpg 800w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SFTW_51-630x630.jpg 630w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SFTW_51-600x600-cropped.jpg 600w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SFTW_51-1200x1200-cropped.jpg 1200w, https://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SFTW_51.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>(1) On Friday we finally had the chance to go to the new brunch spot nearby called Snooze! This is a Denver-based restaurant, and it is very popular here in Austin. We have tried to go before when there was a three-hour wait, so we were glad to hear it was only a fifteen minute wait this time around. Let me just say, we totally get the hype now! The food was soooo delicious. We split an benedict sampler and a pancake flight. This picture shows our pancake flight with our pancake flavor selection of pineapple upside down, blueberry danish, and french toast.</p>
<p>(2) We visited the local Umlauf sculpture garden on Friday. It is a neat sculpture garden very close to our apartment. It was nice to walk around in the shade and enjoy nature for a bit.</p>
<p>(3) We went out to the famous Oasis restaurant on Lake Travis Saturday night for dinner. This was our view while waiting for a table. We were so surprised at how massive the Oasis is! It&#8217;s basically a theme park. It has a  gift shop, a line for getting your name on the list, and even a photographer walking around trying to sell you your picture at your table.</p>
<p>(4) We ran across a popsicle stand called Steel City Pops while walking down S 1st Street this weekend. I had a peaches and cream popsicle, and Daniel had an avocado popsicle. They were both great, but the avocado one was surprisingly the best!</p>
