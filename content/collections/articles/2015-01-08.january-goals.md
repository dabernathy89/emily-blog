<p>Happy New Year! It feels so nice to type that&#8230;. I&#8217;ve been really looking forward to this year for a while. With this new year came a new town (Austin!), a new office with my company, a new apartment, and a new outlook on life. I am so excited to see what is in store in 2015.</p>
<p>Usually I write a whole list of goals for the New Year, but for some reason, I just couldn&#8217;t think of much to write. I guess it&#8217;s because the things that I want to work on in 2015 are the same as they have always been (read more, exercise more, work on Project Life more, travel more, save more, journal more, spend more time reading the Bible, etc, etc.). Since I&#8217;ve told myself constantly that I want to do these things through my monthly goal posts, it seems repetitive to put the same things into a 2015 goals post. But, even though I know I&#8217;m risking being repetitive on this blog, I still would like to continue monthly goal posts. I think monthly goals just make more sense for me right now than big goals for the entire year. So, let&#8217;s jump on into what I hope to accomplish in what&#8217;s left of the month of January!</p>
<h3>Read the <a href="http://shereadstruth.com/category/plans/john/" target="_blank">current SheReadsTruth plan</a> and journal every single morning.</h3>
<p>This is the year that I am going to make studying the Word a priority. I want to read the Bible and journal my thoughts daily. I want to read and understand the writings of other Christians through the SheReadsTruth study plan and through books.</p>
<h3>Get back to my gym classes.</h3>
<p>Over the weekend Daniel and I went to sign up for the local Gold&#8217;s Gym here. They mostly have all the classes I attended and loved at my gym in Northern Virginia, so I&#8217;m excited to continue those. I didn&#8217;t do any working out at all during our move and over Christmas, so it&#8217;s time to get back into shape. This also means earlier bed times for me because I have to work out in the early mornings (I can never, ever make myself go after work in the evenings).</p>
<h3>Set up a budget and be ready to stick to it by February.</h3>
<p>We have some big financial goals for this year, so we need to create a budget and actually stick to it. I&#8217;m excited to use <a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/" target="_blank">YNAB</a> to create our budget.</p>
<h3>Meal plan and grocery shop every weekend.</h3>
<p>We really, really slacked on this for the past couple of months. I just feel so much more organized, healthy, and happy if I have planned out and prepared for balanced meals.</p>
<h3>Start catching up on <a href="http://beckyhiggins.com/project-life/" target="_blank">Project Life</a> (digitally).</h3>
<p>I think I finally came to my senses and realized that I won&#8217;t be able to keep up with the physical form of Project Life. However, they released <a href="http://beckyhiggins.com/project-life-app/" target="_blank">a digital format</a> at the end of last year, so I&#8217;m excited to dive in and create Project Life pages right on my iPad! I resisted this form of Project life for several months, but since I created a total of zero physical Project Life pages while resisting digital, I&#8217;ve realized that my dream of creating the physical version was unrealistic. I&#8217;ll still be able to print out the pages created digitally and put them into albums, so the final product won&#8217;t be much different from what I&#8217;m used to.</p>
<h3>Read two books.</h3>
<p>If you have been reading this blog for more than a few months, then you know this is constantly a goal of mine. I succeeded in meeting my goal of reading 24 books again last year, and I feel like two books a month is perfect for me. I&#8217;d like to increase this goal, but with my schedule, I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s setting myself up for failure, so I think I will stick to two per month.</p>
<p>Well, those are my plans for this month! I haven&#8217;t decided if I&#8217;m going to do mid-month check-ins this year, but I&#8217;ll at least be re-capping my progress whenever I&#8217;m back to share February goals.</p>
