<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>(1) To kick off our weekend at home, we walked down to the Biscuits + Groovy food truck for breakfast. It was delicious, especially with a Top Chico to wash it down!</p>
<p>(2) Sunday we met up with our long-time friends Jordan and Kim and their baby girl. Their baby is so adorable. I loved holding her and watching her observe her surroundings. 🙂</p>
<p>(3) Said brunch (^) was at Bonhomie, a local French restaurant. I ordered the Croque Monsieur, and it was divine! The bread was thicker than other Croque Monsieur&#8217;s I&#8217;ve had in the past, which was delightful because I was able to soak up more of the cheese topping with it. 🙂</p>
<p>(4) Sunday night we grilled burgers in our apartment courtyard, ate Torchy&#8217;s chips &amp; queso, and relaxed. A perfect end to the weekend!</p>

<li>It was a great week for cooking at our house! We made some yummy weeknight meals. Our favorite: slow-cooker chicken burrito bowls from the <a href="http://amzn.to/2wH2YPx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skinnytaste Fast &amp; Slow</a> cookbook.</li>
<li>Trying out the new ATX Cocina restaurant on Friday night. It was good, but I feel it was overpriced for what we got. I&#8217;d love to try happy hour next time we go. It&#8217;s supposed to be a great one!</li>
<li>A Saturday morning/ early afternoon full of cleaning and organizing</li>
<li>A Saturday night spent starting the final season of Downton Abbey. I&#8217;m really going to miss these characters when we finish the show!</li>
<li>A stop at Fleet Coffee Co. for a new bag of coffee beans. I love getting recommendations from the guys at Fleet, and I like how they rotate their featured roasters. We left with a citrusy, El Salvadorian roast and immediately made pour overs when we got home. I recommend it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
