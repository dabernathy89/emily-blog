<p>Happy Monday! Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series. In these quick posts, I share the highlights from my week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events.</p>
<p>This week was different from usual. I stayed home sick <strong>Monday</strong> and <strong>Tuesday</strong> (I had started getting sick on Superbowl Sunday). I finally left the house for the first time since Sunday for a Target run on Tuesday night where I picked up some essentials and a couple of fun things (lots of birthdays and events coming up!).</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong> I was back at work and out at a client site. We went to Odd Duck for dinner, a restaurant walking distance from our apartment. It&#8217;s the kind of place where you order several smaller dishes to share. The food was great! We are excited to live so close to a place like that.</p>
<p>On <strong>Friday</strong>, Daniel had some friends come over to hang out for the weekend, and I went over to my sister&#8217;s place for a girls&#8217; night. She cooked dinner for me and one of her friends , and afterwards, we snacked on a cheese and cracker platter while watching one of my favorite moves &#8211; About Time!</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong> I did some work and ran some errands. We ate some delicious BBQ for lunch at Terry Black&#8217;s. It was a gorgeous day in Austin, so we got to eat outside and enjoy the sunshine.  That evening, I worked some more while Daniel hosted a poker night in the game room downstairs.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday</strong> was really relaxing. We went to lunch at a Mexican restaurant with our friend Mike, relaxed and did things around the apartment, and went out for the most delicious ramen for dinner. Just look at this bowl of goodness!</p>

<p>The best part of the day was Skyping with Kaitlin (who I miss dearly!!) in the evening.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s time to start the second full week of February! Have a great week!</p>
