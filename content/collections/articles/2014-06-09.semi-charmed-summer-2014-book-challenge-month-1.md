<p>I&#8217;m not going to do a Weekly Wishes post this week since I&#8217;m in Texas spending time with friends and family and because I didn&#8217;t set any week goals last week. In place of my usual Weekly Wishes post, I thought it was about time I do my first check in the for summer book challenge I&#8217;m doing. To see the full list of books I&#8217;m planning to read for the challenge, click <a title="Semi-Charmed Summer 2014 Book Challenge" href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/2014/05/01/semi-charmed-summer-2014-book-challenge/" target="_blank">here</a>.
