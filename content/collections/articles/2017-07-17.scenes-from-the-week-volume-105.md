<p>Welcome to my Scenes From the Week series! In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose.</p>

<p>(1) On Monday I went to happy hour at Red Ash with a combined group of co-workers and ex co-workers. It was great to get together with such a fun group and see the people who had left my company awhile ago. As of now, only four of us in this photo still currently work for EY (one is me),  and one of those three has their last day this coming Friday.  I get so sad when friends leave my company, but I&#8217;m very excited for them to explore new opportunities. By the way, Red Ash has an amazing happy hour with great deals on delicious Italian dishes!</p>
<p>(2) I&#8217;ve mentioned my love for my <a href="http://www.mistobox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mistobox</a> subscription a few times on the blog (no, I&#8217;m not sponsored in any way). I received a bag of beans from them this week, and I LOVE the Barefoot Nicaraguan roast they sent this time around. As you can see, Banana was very interested as well. 🙂</p>
<p>(3) We had date night on Friday and went out for some snacks and a movie. House Wine, a wine bar near our apartment, had given us a couple of vouchers that gave us some snacks and wine for free on our first visit to the new (adorable!) Tasting Lounge in the back. We couldn&#8217;t believe how generous those vouchers were &#8211; everything pictured here was free!</p>
<p>(4) On Saturday my friend Becca and her husband Sino came to stay with us. Becca is my best friend from high school, and it&#8217;s always so wonderful to catch up with her. We had fun hanging out around Austin and Dripping Springs and introducing them to some good friends here in Austin.</p>

<ul>
<li>Going to see <i>Baby Driver </i>Friday night. It was good but not really my type of movie. We mostly went to see it because Daniel couldn&#8217;t stop talking about how we needed to see it in theaters. 🙂</li>
<li>Enjoying a few meals at home. We haven&#8217;t had the time to cook very creatively these days, but it&#8217;s still nice to scrounge something up in your own kitchen and enjoy a meal at home.</li>
<li>FINALLY wrapping up a new travel post that I will be posting this week. I think I&#8217;m getting back some of my creative energy after a long dry spell&#8230;.</li>
<li>Planning for our upcoming NYC trip. We leave this coming Thursday night and cannot wait to eat lots of food and see lots several new, less-touristy areas of the city!</li>

<p><i>{Thanks for reading! Want to know a little more about me? I&#8217;m a CPA learning how to balance a career with frequent travel while planting roots at home in Austin, TX.
