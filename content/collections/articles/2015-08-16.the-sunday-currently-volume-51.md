<p>Lauren is back with her <a href="http://siddathornton.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Sunday Currently link-up</a>! This link-up played a very big part of my first year of blogging. While participating in that link-up, I met several of my blogging friends that I still keep up with today! I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;ll be participating every week this time around, but I&#8217;m excited to join in whenever I can!</p>

<p><b><em>Currently…</em> </b></p>
<p><em>Reading </em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everything-Never-Told-You-Novel-ebook/dp/B00G3L7V0C/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439775409&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=everything+i+never+told+you" target="_blank">Everything I Never Told You</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Me-Before-You-Jojo-Moyes/dp/0143124544" target="_blank">Me Before You</a> (on audiobook), and lots of travel magazines</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>lots of posts about our trip to Peru. I have so much to share! Going through our pictures and videos makes me miss that beautiful country already.</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to the Mates of State album<em> Re-arrange Us. </em>Daniel and I saw them in concert in DC, and I hadn&#8217;t really listened to them much since. The album has been on non-stop today.</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>about Daniel and his exciting upcoming week. Last year, he and some college friends started an annual tradition of hiking a piece of the Appalachian Trail for a week. He left this morning for this year&#8217;s hike and will return Saturday. I will be missing him very much but am so excited to hear about his adventure!</p>
<p><em>Smelling </em> the remaining bits of my Lighthouse Bath and Body Works candle</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>for a productive week at work with little stress. It&#8217;s that time of year again that I refer to often during periods of absence on my blog &#8211; &#8220;busy season&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>a new, summery black dress that I wore to dinner with my sister and her boyfriend tonight. We went out to celebrate my sister&#8217;s graduation from grad school! I hadn&#8217;t seen them since before our trip to Peru, so it was great to catch up.</p>
<p><em>Loving  </em>snuggles with <a href="http://www.everydayaccountsblog.com/category/lazy-days-with-banana/" target="_blank">Banana</a>, bubble baths, catching up with family and friends, sleeping in, getting organized</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>to start the week off right by getting a really good night&#8217;s sleep tonight</p>
<p><em>Needing </em> a glass of ice water. I just realized that I&#8217;ve had very little water today (but plenty of coffee!).</p>
<p><em>Feeling  </em>content. We have lots of fun weekend plans coming up over the next few months.</p>
<p><em>Clicking  </em>Snapchat all the time these days. Snapchat stories are so fun to fill in little spare moments of time!</p>
