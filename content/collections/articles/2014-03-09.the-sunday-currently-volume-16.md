<p>It has been both a relaxing and very productive weekend. Friday night Daniel and I escaped as early as we could from our offices to grab a BBQ dinner (pictured above). While it was not nearly as amazing as good ole Southern BBQ, we definitely enjoyed indulging in the reminder of home. After dinner, we saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024469/" target="_blank">Non-Stop</a> and both really liked it. On Saturday, I worked in the morning and afternoon but took a break for a yoga/pilates class in between. After I wrapped up my work, we did a little cleaning around the apartment, went to church, and then dropped by Trader Joe&#8217;s to pick up some groceries for the week. Once we dropped off the groceries at home, we went out for Mexican &#8211; clearly we are treating ourselves a little to much this weekend! I won&#8217;t complain though. 😉</p>
<h2><b><em>Currently&#8230;</em> </b></h2>
<p><em>Reading  </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Workweek-Anywhere-Expanded/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394387527&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+4+hour+work+week" target="_blank">The 4-Hour Workweek</a> by Timothy Ferriss; I really enjoy reading different philosophies on work and careers, and given the popularity of this book (and the fact that it was on my library&#8217;s wait list for about 5 months), I&#8217;m very curious what all the fuss is about. I&#8217;m also reading the second section of  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Compassion-Reflection-Christian-Henri-Nouwen/dp/0385517521/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393778816&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=compassion+a+reflection+on+the+christian+life" target="_blank">Compassion: A Reflection on Christian Life</a> by Henri Nouwen for our small group study. Minutes before writing this blog post, I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Allegiant-Divergent-Series-Veronica-Roth/dp/006202406X" target="_blank">Allegiant</a> by Veronica Roth. I actually really liked how it ended and highly recommend it despite many reviews saying the opposite.</p>
<p><em>Writing  </em>an outline for my next <a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/category/travel-with-me/" target="_blank">travel</a> post</p>
<p><em>Listening  </em>to the hustle and bustle of the Starbucks cafe in Barnes and Noble</p>
<p><em>Thinking  </em>how nice it is that I&#8217;m not slaving away at the office today like I thought I was going to have to (thankful for productive Saturdays!)</p>
<p><em>Smelling</em>  coffee brewing in the cafe</p>
<p><em>Wishing </em> that I had slept a little more last night. Usually Saturday nights are my time to catch up on sleep, but with the time change and staying up later than normal last night, I only got 6 and a half hours &#8211; my usual during the work week</p>
<p><em>Hoping  </em>to have time to explore that travel book section here in a little bit. I&#8217;m excited to start forming plans for our London/Paris trip in May! Let me know if you have any restaurant/ activity/ sightseeing recommendations for either city!</p>
<p><em>Wearing  </em>jeans, a sweater, and my beloved Sperry&#8217;s</p>
<p><em>Loving </em> <del></del>that I already got my workout in today!</p>
<p><em>Wanting  </em>Spring! Isn&#8217;t everyone?</p>
<p><em>Needing  </em>to do a full-organizational re-haul of our apartment. Maybe I&#8217;ll start by picking the biggest problem areas and adding them to my <a href="http://everydayaccountsblog.com/category/weekly-wishes/" target="_blank">Weekly Wishes</a>. Spring is around the corner, and isn&#8217;t that the time to organize and clean?</p>
<p><em>Feeling</em>  excited about planning for the future</p>
