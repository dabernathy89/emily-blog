Obviously, we considered everywhere we went to be baby-friendly, and I think we did a good job hitting the Nashville food scene!"

At this point, I was still on maternity leave, so there wasn't any reason for us to not tag along and make a trip out of it. We flew in on a Wednesday, and we had planned to fly back very late Monday night. We ended up being delayed until Tuesday, but I'll share more on that later. For this trip, it started with Daniel's conference on Thursday and Friday, and then it was family vacation the rest of the time. We snuck in some time with my cousin, lots of delicious food, and plenty of rest & relaxation. (We also dealt with a fender bender in our rental car that was not our fault, but I've put that stressful experience behind me.)"
