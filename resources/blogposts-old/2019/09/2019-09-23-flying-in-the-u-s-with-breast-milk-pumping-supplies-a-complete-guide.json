There is a lot that goes into traveling with breast milk and pumping away from home, and it can be daunting. I remember doing many hours of research trying to put together the pieces on how to prepare. I thought I'd put together a guide that can help you know exactly what you should expect when making your way to an airport with a bag full of breast milk and pumping supplies."

At first, it was very painful, but even after the pain faded, it was extremely time-intensive. Carson took over an hour and a half, sometimes longer, for every feeding session, even in the middle of the night. We quickly learned that Carson was having trouble getting enough milk which translated into the very long feeding sessions. Carson was losing weight, and I wasn't able to pump enough in between breastfeeding sessions, so after many lactation consultations, ENT appointments, and some feeding therapy appointments, we knew we needed to start supplementing with formula. Even though we were supplementing, I continued to try to breastfeed until Carson was around four months old. At that time, I made the decision to stop breastfeeding in the traditional way and to start breastfeeding via pumping as much as I could. Thus began my journey of needing to travel with breast milk whether or not I had Carson with me on the journey."
