In these posts, I share the highlights from my previous month ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. I recently took a huge break from these posts (and all posts), but I'm excited to be back to them. Now that I have a baby boy, everyday moments are extra special!"
