I have always wanted to travel with our children during all life stages, and while we have done a bit of domestic travel with Carson, this was our first international trip as a family of three. So today I'm sharing our trip with you including all of the toddler-friendly things we did while there. I hope it can be used as a guide for others planning trips to London with littles."

Unfortunately, booking with points meant we weren't able to take advantage of the recently added direct flights between Austin and London, but our connection was in Houston, so it wasn't too inconvenient. I can share more about how I find points deals on flights in another separate post if there is any interest - we've booked many free flights (domestic and international) over the past five or six years since I started dabbling in the world of travel hacking."

Our flight to London was overnight. Carson slept about four hours total before he was woken up by an elderly man the next row over who did not realize how loudly he was speaking to his wife in the row behind him. Carson wasn't able to fall back asleep after that, which made for a long second half of the flight (think very sleepy parents trading off entertaining a toddler). However, there were no tantrums, blowouts, or screaming fits, so I took it as a win."

Also, we had a really bad layover in Houston on our way back to Austin (long lines, extra grumpy TSA agents, and, oh, did you know that babies need their own separate Global Entry pass?), but Carson, by some miracle, was so happy and content to sit in his stroller while we dealt with everything else. I will definitely write a separate post about international flights with a young toddler, but that is not the focus of this post."

The rooms were set up very nicely with a little kitchenette, and the bedroom was separate from the living area, so we were able to put Carson in his own room for his 7:30pm bedtime. The hotel provided a pack 'n play for Carson to sleep in. The best part, however, was the location of the hotel. Bermondsey Street is full of wonderful-looking restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops. We especially enjoyed the coffee from The Watch House, which was just a few feet from our hotel. Unfortunately, we ran out of time to try many of the restaurants. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the London Bridge Station, a major Underground and railway station that provides transit to nearly anywhere you want to go."

All modes of transport offered designated spots for strollers, so we were mostly able to keep Carson in the stroller for our rides. Additionally, many stations in London offer elevators - there was only one instance when we had to wait a very long time in line to get on the elevator. We used the Citymapper app for our route planning, and you can filter for accessible routes in your search to eliminate stations without elevators. I'll go into more detail about stroller-friendly public transportation in London in a future post."

The company says that you are responsible for ensuring the car seats are secure, but this can be difficult when you're not familiar with the types of car seats they use. For our trip from the Airbnb to the airport at the end, Daniel just installed our own car seat that we had brought for the plane and rental car. Otherwise Family Transfers provided great customer service and timely, safe transfers. It's nice to book private transfer to and from the airport, especially when traveling with a small child with lots of luggage."

There are all kinds of things for kids to do - play on a pirate ship, slide, swing, run, etc. I love these photos of Carson playing alongside all the local London kiddos."
