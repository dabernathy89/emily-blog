My husband and I have used Airbnb quite a bit, especially during our three month backpacking trip in Europe. In addition to the cost savings there are other advantages to using Airbnb, including conveniences like kitchen and laundry facilities, the privacy of a whole home or apartment, and the ability to stay in fun neighborhoods which might not have hotels at all. However, there can be downsides too, such as coordinating key pick-up with the owners, lack of airport transportation, and often having no place to store luggage before check-in or after check-out. One day I'll write a post that shares more detail on my thoughts on staying in a hotel versus Airbnb, but I wanted to toss out a few thoughts here. Back to booking your place to stay! After looking at the details of several listings and coming up with a good list, you are ready to move on to step 4."
