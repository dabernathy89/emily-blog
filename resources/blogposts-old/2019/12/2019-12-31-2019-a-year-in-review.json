I blogged very little in 2018 after the birth of my son and found myself unable to get back into any sort of routine or day-to-day life tasks until early 2019. I'm sad I didn't get that posted - maybe I'll do a retrospective look at 2018 at some point. But today I'm here to share a look at 2019!"

I started blogging again. I started a position at work that has freed up my schedule and has allowed me to be a part-time working mom/part-time stay-at-home mom. Our baby boy had many milestones including learning to walk, turning one, starting daycare, getting a passport and traveling overseas, and starting to talk. Late in the year, we found out that we are expecting another baby boy in April 2020! Daniel, Carson, and I have just had such a blast in these early months of growing our little family."
