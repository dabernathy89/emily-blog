So, we once again pulled out the tablet to try to get a few bites in peace, but even then, he started throwing the tablet on the ground. So, we kind of had to rush through this meal and get out of there so as not to disturb the other diners. I wish I could have paid a little more attention to the food, but so it goes with a toddler."
