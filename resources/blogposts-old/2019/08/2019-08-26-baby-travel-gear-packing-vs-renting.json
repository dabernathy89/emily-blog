In Nashville, we opted to pick up the equipment because we had a rental car. This was also a very pleasant experience; the woman who runs Baby's Away in Nashville lives conveniently between the airport and the main part of town, so we drove to her house and picked the item up off her back porch. We did the same thing on our way back to the Nashville airport. In Denver, we were driving many miles outside of the city, so we paid to have the company meet us at the airport car rental facility for both arrival and departure."

As I mentioned earlier, we weren't completely satisfied with our experience in Denver, and that is because we received a high chair that was a little worn, hard to use, and uncomfortable for Carson, and the pack 'n play we received came in a carrier with a broken zipper. However, both items were still usable. In both Chicago and Nashville, we were completely satisfied with the cleanliness and use of what we received. So, the baby equipment rental process may vary from city to city, but overall, I recommend it. It makes travel easier and less stressful, which I believe is very important for the family travel experience with a little one."
