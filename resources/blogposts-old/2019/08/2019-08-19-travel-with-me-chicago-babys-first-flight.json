And, even though we were \"newbies\" to traveling with a little one, we came home from that trip feeling like we made the most of our time in the Windy City, so I feel comfortable sharing this post as a guide to enjoying a trip to Chicago with a baby. I have also shared a map outlining our trip at the bottom of this post."

However, using the Chicago public transportation system was no problem for us at all. You will see below in Day 1 that we opted for a private transfer to and from the airport because we had a lot of luggage, but the rest of the time we either walked, rode the Metra rail system, or rode buses. I discuss some of this more below, but in the end, it was very easy to use public transit, even with a full diaper bag and an infant in a stroller."
