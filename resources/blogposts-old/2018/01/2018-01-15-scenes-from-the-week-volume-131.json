Homestead Heritage is an agrarian Christian community in Waco, and they welcome the general public to their restaurant and grounds on certain days of the week. You can tour their Craft Village, where they sell baskets, soaps, and other crafts that they make, and their blacksmith (pictured here) and woodworking workshops, where they also offer classes to the public. It's a neat place to visit! I think that the highlight is the cafe where they serve locally-sourced food - many of the seasonal ingredients are sourced from their own farms. Our brunch was wonderful!"

I was surprised to see that there is no longer a line to get into the main store, but there is a MASSIVE line at the bakery (which wasn't open when I last went). We weren't up for waiting over an hour for a cupcake, so after my mom kindly bought each of us a Magnolia candle, we scoped out another dessert place. We ended up at Collin Street Bakery where I got a very yummy apple cinnamon muffin."
