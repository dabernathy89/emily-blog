There is so much inspirational content out there (blogs, articles, books, vlogs), and I've spent a lot of time seeking out these resources and reading them over the past week. I'm very excited to get moving on a new year and keep myself accountable by starting a new little monthly series on the blog. Instead of sharing my annual goals on the blog, I'm going to share the monthly to-dos I'm setting for myself. Most of these \"to-dos\" will be progress steps leading up to the annual goals I have written in my "
