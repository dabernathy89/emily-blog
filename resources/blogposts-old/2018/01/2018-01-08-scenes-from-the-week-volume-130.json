The terrible cold I had before came back in full force on Friday morning, just in time for Heather and Cody's weekend visit. Heather and Cody are some of our very best friends from college, so I was pretty bummed to be sick while they were here. We made the most of it and had an enjoyable, relaxing weekend together. They left this morning, and I'm already missing them! :("

I've been fascinated about personalities and learning how different types interact with each other (in both healthy and unhealthy ways), but I've put off reading many books on them because the amount of material out there is overwhelming. Anne gives great summaries as well as a wonderful list of references for further learning in the back of the book. I'm looking forward to diving more into the Enneagram and the five love languages. (P.S. I'm playing with the idea of writing about what books I read each month and my thoughts. I don't feel that I do a great job describing books, but I could try and do my best! Any thoughts?)"
