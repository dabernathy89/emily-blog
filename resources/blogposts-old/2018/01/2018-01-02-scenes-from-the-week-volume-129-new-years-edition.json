We had visited the original location a couple years ago when we were in San Antonio (formerly called Local Coffee), and that visit was the beginning of our journey into the world of coffee. It was one of the first places where we asked questions about the coffee beans used and methods of brewing."

We made pancakes and eggs for breakfast, had chips and queso at Alamo Drafthouse during a movie, ate Indian food at Tarka for dinner, and ended the evening at Gourdough's for donuts. I ordered the donut in the picture, Granny's Pie, and it. was. INCREDIBLE. It was my first time to go to the actual brick-and-mortar location (and not the food truck), and we had a great time enjoying our final indulgence of the holidays before heading home for a cozy night in."

Now, some of those books were really short, so I don't want to give myself too much credit, but it was still a lot of reading for me. This resulted in sparking a renewed love and motivation for books, and I'm excited to work toward my new (ambitious) goal of reading 40 books during 2018.
