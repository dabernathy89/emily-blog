I had so many hopes and dreams for getting the year started on the right foot and having lots of time to enjoy my final months without a child. But I really should know better by now after six years in public accounting. Every year, once Christmas is over, and I take a few more days off in January, I head back to work, and then BAM.... All there is time for is work. Busy season in public accounting is no joke. Last week things finally started to slow down a little bit, but it was still a 55 hour week. Now, I don't want to sit here feeling sorry for myself, but I did want to mention this as the reason I've not posted on the blog in nearly a month."

I'm already at the point where I have appointments every two weeks with my OB. Our hospital classes start in a couple of weeks. I read a fantastic book on raising babies ("

All of the names that I love, Daniel doesn't love, and vice versa. There is still time though, so I'm trying not to panic about that. Everyday, we get more and more excited as we get closer to meeting our little man. Oh, and he is a wiggle worm, and we have lots of fun feeling him move and staring at my stomach as it does gymnastics. :)"

In the top left photo above, my friend Kaitlin and I are standing in front of one of the many beautiful antique doors that could be purchased from this massive international antique shop. It was very cool to browse through furniture and artifacts from all of the world, including giant elephant doors from India!"
