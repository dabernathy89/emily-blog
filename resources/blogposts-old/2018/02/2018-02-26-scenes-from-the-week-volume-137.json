The concert was great. St. Vincent is pretty weird with her outfits and sets, but the music is fun, and I especially loved the opening act - her aunt and uncle Tuck & Patti. They are an adorable couple and musical duo performing primarily jazz music. I don't typically love jazz, but these two were such a joy to watch. My favorite part was watching Tuck do a solo guitar performance of Santana's \"Europa\". His guitar skills are incredible!"
