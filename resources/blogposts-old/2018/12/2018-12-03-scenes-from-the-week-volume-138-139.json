One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. I recently took a huge break from these posts (and all posts), but I'm excited to get back to them. I won't be back every week, but I want to share them when I can. Now that I have a baby boy, everyday moments are extra special!"
