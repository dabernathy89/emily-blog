As I think back through these seven months, it seems that I blinked and they were gone. At the same time, it feels like those extra tough early months are long past and that I've had a happy, easygoing baby for ages."

Something clicked and everything became so much easier starting in month four. Carson reached a healthy weight percentile. He started sleeping through the night and taking longer naps. He started smiling and giggling all the time. We finally made a firm decision on a feeding plan after stressing for months about what was best for our baby.  I was a lot more comfortable going on solo outings with Carson, so we started weekly grocery and Target trips, more frequent play dates, and many walks along the Lady Bird Lake trails."

He can now sit up on his own and has started playing with toys independently, sometimes for as long as ten minutes. He is army crawling already (I can hardly believe it!). He really loves trying new foods - he currently has oatmeal for breakfast and some sort of fruit/veggie puree for lunch and dinner (in addition to his milk). Carson has so much fun at his swim lessons with his sweet baby friends, and bath time is basically his favorite time. I think he is a future musician because he loves listening to music, his toy piano keeps his attention most days, and he couldn't stop staring at the drummer during a baby music class we went to for Halloween."

Carson hasn't fallen into much of a regular nap routine yet, so his first nap is often only half an hour but can sometimes go for up to two hours. I try to eat breakfast and get ready during this nap, and if he sleeps long enough, I'll start doing some house cleaning during this time. After his first nap and second bottle of the day is when I try to get us out of the house to do something (but if his first nap is super short, I usually wait to go out after his second nap)."

The second nap is usually the longest nap of the day, so I try to do some more cleaning during this time or do something fun like work on his baby book, read a book, or watch a TV show. When Carson wakes up, he has his third bottle of the day, and we play some more and maybe walk down the hall to check the mail and wave to the people at the front desk. Depending on the timing of his second nap, he may need another nap before being up for the evening around 5:45."
