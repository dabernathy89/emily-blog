While I'm hopeful for a more \"normal\" 2021 (travel! friend gatherings! getting out of the house more!), I will continue to hold tight to my babies and be grateful for my blessings even if we don't see that normalcy come to fruition for a while. I've written one of these posts every year since my blog began (except for 2018), and I love looking back on them!"
