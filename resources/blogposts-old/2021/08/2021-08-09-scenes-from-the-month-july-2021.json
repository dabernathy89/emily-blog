One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have babies, everyday moments are extra special!"

He packed his last few months full of social activities: Sunday school, family visits, Ellen's wedding, Caden's birthday party, and more. I wanted to share what I wrote for his service here like I did for Mimi:"

I loved filling up a cup of candy from his Runts dispenser and settling in to observe a small part of his work routine and watch his friendly conversations with his employees and clients. I first became interested in the CPA world because I wanted to be like Papa one day. Once I went on to college and then onto my career as a CPA, Papa would always ask about what I was learning and working on. I've truly enjoyed sharing these conversations with Papa - not only was he one of the few interested in an accounting career, but I have also always been proud of my similarities with him."

Back when we were preparing to drive to Waco for Mimi's funeral, I was telling him about all of the cousins who would be at Terry and Vicki's to play with him. He said \"Oh! You forgot Papa!\".  I had a very similar conversation with him again yesterday, getting him excited for the weekend ahead, and he once again asked about Papa. While he doesn't yet understand, I told him Papa is in Heaven with Mimi. Even though he is just 3 years old, I don't think he will ever forget some of his Papa memories. My last memory with Papa was taking the kids to the hospital last week to visit. Carson and Caden were both very proud to sing and dance to Wheels on the Bus and ABCs as Papa clapped along."
