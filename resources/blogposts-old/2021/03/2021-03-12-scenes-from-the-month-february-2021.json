One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have babies, everyday moments are extra special!"

We all got some good laughs out of Carson rolling around on her walker, his favorite toy. She loved holding the boys when she could, even when they were too squirmy to sit for long."

We made the trip to Graham and Wichita Falls for Mr. Gatti's and the movie theater. She supported us as we practiced (and argued over) our numerous cousin \"plays\". She encouraged lots of time playing outdoors in their big, beautiful yard. And she was always in that kitchen constantly cooking delicious meals and snacks all day long. She and Papa made sure the freezer was stocked full of mini Blue Bell ice creams at all times. And most evenings would end in trading off turns for a wonderful Mimi back rub. Mimi had a heart of service and always thought of how she could serve and show love to her family. Since then, with Mimi and Papa's move to Aledo and then Waco, they both continued to attend most of my and my sibling's milestone events over the years. They always sent a birthday card. My life would not be the same without all of my Mimi memories."
