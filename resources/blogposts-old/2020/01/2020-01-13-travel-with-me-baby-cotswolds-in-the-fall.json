There are MANY options for quick trips outside of London, so it took us awhile to make a final decision on the destination. In the end, we decided to head to central England to the dreamy countryside and quaint villages of the Cotswolds. I'd seen so many beautiful photos of this area of England in the past, and it seemed like a great, easy-going addition to a London trip with a toddler. It ended up being the perfect choice for us! We were able to plan our drives around Carson's nap time, stop any time we needed to stretch our legs or change a diaper, and eat whenever/wherever we wanted. And, let me tell you, ALL the villages in Cotswolds that we saw were stop-worthy and Instagram-able. I've been telling everyone that they looked like little movie sets scattered across the countryside."

They did not have any flexibility to add a baby to a two-person room at the couple of places I looked, so we would have been required to book TWO rooms for two adults and a baby. No, thank you. The Holiday Inn was fine. They gave us a really uncomfortable bed for Carson, so we tried to add some extra padding. Because of this, Carson had some trouble sleeping which is highly unusual, so we were ready to grab the free breakfast and go in the morning. We met a really nice woman at the front desk, listened to some of her recommendations, and then made our way out for day two of our road trip!"
