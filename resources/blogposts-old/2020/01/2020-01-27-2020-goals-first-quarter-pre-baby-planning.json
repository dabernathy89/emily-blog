Honestly, my mindset wasn't very healthy in 2018 either."

I now have a much more manageable role at work, and I only work three days a week and stay home with my toddler the other days. I dug up my 2018 undated PowerSheets, did all of the prep work in an outside notebook (because I had filled in all those pages already in 2018), and started my January 2020 Tending List in the first unused month section. The PowerSheets are all about breaking down larger goals into very manageable mini goals and tending to those goals each week and each month. So, for 2020, my plan is to have quarterly goals that I can break down into very specific action items each month and each week."

The second quarter will encompass the first three months of our baby's life (the \"fourth trimester\") so survival and keeping our two-year-old and newborn alive and engaged will probably be my only goals. The third quarter will be all about trying to find our new normal during the last half of my maternity leave. And the fourth quarter will be more about routine, getting back to work, and establishing more rhythems as a family of four."
