The most useful and innovative feature of the app, however, is that GPSMyCity has created an accompanying interactive map for each article in their app. For a $1.99 upgrade, you have access to these offline GPS-powered guides for every travel article you've saved. As of now, they have over 6,500 walks mapped out in over 1,000 cities, all available for downloading onto an app right now."

In those situations, having offline access to the articles you want to pull travel ideas and details from can be really useful. Additionally, I know I like to do some last-minute research on the plane before I arrive somewhere, so being able to save articles for plane research is also valuable since I rarely want to pay for WiFi on the plane. With GPSMyCity apps, you can have offline access to your favorite travel articles and blog posts for free. And, for $1.99 you are able to upgrade any article to be GPS-guided, meaning you will will access to a map that will show you and guide you to all of the sites and locations that the article references, all without using phone data. The app is also able to track where you've already walked in the city which can be really useful for orienting yourself to a new destination."

I've noticed that on iPhone, the link will always direct you to the app store, even if you have already downloaded the app, so I recommend just searching in the app. The company has told me that this is an iPhone limitation."
