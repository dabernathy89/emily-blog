While I have not been collecting mugs nearly as rapidly as I did between the first two posts, I definitely have enough to share an update again! My travel mug collection posts have been very well received in the past, so hopefully it's another enjoyable/useful post."

You will notice that there are two types of mugs in the pictures below. We started out by collecting the Global Icon series. Starbucks has since discontinued this series in the U.S., so we then we collected the new You Are Here series for U.S. destinations and the Global Icon series for international destinations. Now, they have the You Are Here series for both U.S. and international destinations, and the designs have changed. Needless to say, the collection has evolved over time. So now it's time for you to join me on a trip down memory lane as I talk through our collection!"

While most of the time Daniel was just working in the hotel room and waiting for me to get back to the room at 2am, Daniel and I were able to enjoy one Sunday together doing some sightseeing, so I really enjoy remembering that day when I use this mug."

I really should do an updated NYC travel post because we've been three more times since 2014 - In 2016 we went at Christmastime again with our good friends Kaelin & Andres (so fun to travel with friends!), in the summer of 2017, we went right before Daniel's work conference, and again in the summer of 2019, we took a baby-free trip before another conference for Daniel.
