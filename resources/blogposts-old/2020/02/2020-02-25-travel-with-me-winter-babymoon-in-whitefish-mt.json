We had a long layover, but I enjoyed reading and people watching while Daniel got some work done. We arrived late at night, so we just stayed at a TownePlace Suites I booked with Marriott points for the first evening. We then stayed two nights at a bed and breakfast (see below), and then on Sunday night, we booked a free night at a Holiday Inn Express before our VERY early flight home on Monday morning. We did have a rental car for this trip, which I think is pretty necessary unless you are staying downtown with no plans to go driving in the mountains or nearby towns."

This place was magical! We booked the Big Sky Suite because of the fireplace, and it made for the most relaxing two days. The breakfast was one of the best parts. Hopefully they are serving the huckleberry pancakes when you visit (yum!). Also, all of the employees at the lodge were really friendly and kind, offering lots of local recommendations.

The rest of the park was closed because of the snow, and the Lake MacDonald Lodge we had intended to go to was also closed. However, we still had a nice walk through the snow - we saw lots of beautiful trees, the lake, and some deer. We didn't realize until pulling into the park that it costs $25 per car for entry, but I would say it was worth it even for our short time there. It's such a beautiful area!"
