The birth was very different from my first - Caden was induced and the epidural didn't work all the way (a little scary), and it was just me and Daniel at the hospital for two days. With Carson, there were no delivery scares or complications, and all of our immediate family was there at the hospital to welcome the baby into the world after he was born. Maybe I'll share Caden's labor and delivery story another time. Regardless, everything ended up fine, and baby is healthy and perfect. He instantly filled a space in our family that we didn't know existed."
