There were a few years there where we were able to make travel a big priority, but I couldn't keep up with the posts on top of my full-time job.

In July 2019, we took our then-one-year-old Carson to Colorado. The main reason for the trip was a friend's wedding, but we added on a few days to enjoy the mountains together as a family."
