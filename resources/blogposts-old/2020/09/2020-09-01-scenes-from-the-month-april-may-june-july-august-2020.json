One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have babies, everyday moments are extra special!"

It's really hard for me to do this, but I'm limiting myself to only four photos each month, or else this post would never end! Limiting the photos means they are going to primarily be focused on my kiddos because they are the major highlight of my months, but if I'm able to start posting these monthly again, I hope to continue sharing the smaller highlights from the month such as books, coffee, home decor, etc."

Carson and Daddy built a fort, and we took several family walks. My parents came to meet Caden the weekend after he was born - they kept Carson while we were in the hospital delivering Caden. On April 24th, we celebrated Carson's second birthday! We had planned a fun, outdoor Curious George-themed party for him, but that was unfortunately canceled due to the pandemic. We made the most of it by using the decorations I already had collected and having a family Zoom call. Carson loved the attention (and the blue icing on his cupcake!)."

For my birthday, we did donuts for breakfast and a cheese plate for dinner (my faves). And for our anniversary, we did takeout from our favorite local restaurant, Emmer & Rye. And, of course, we also spent lots of time with our babies on those days. Also this month, many family members came to visit and meet Baby Caden - my sister Ellen & her husband (then fiance) Lane came from Dallas, my sister Elizabeth and her husband Jason brought over Chinese food, my brother came from Waco, and my in-laws came from Fort Worth. We also did some fun things with Carson, like make pizza! It is challenging to entertain a toddler with a newborn during COVID-19 times!"

We did what we could to keep everyone entertained, fed, and happy this month. One weekend, we found some green space in Austin to hang out and burn off some energy. Carson also enjoyed learning about the Armor of God and crafting his own armor in virtual VBS through our church. To be honest, this was one of the harder months we've had in a long time because of lack of sleep, the weather being way too hot to spend much time outside (#Texas), and getting deep into the tough parts of raising a two-year-old, but we have some wonderful memories from it."

We also went to the zoo one weekend, and Carson went to my parents' for one weekend so that we could move Caden into his own room and start sleep training him. We use the Taking Cara Babies method - it worked in two nights for Carson! It's taking a bit longer for Caden, but I think we are close to having another great little sleeper. Oh, and Caden has started playing with his toes and his voice which is adorable."
