One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose. Now that I have a little boy (with another on the way), everyday moments are extra special!"

And, my goodness, how times have changed since then.  I don't want to linger on the devastation of COVID-19 too long on this post, but I do want to acknowledge that it has changed everything about our world in the matter of weeks, and my heart goes out to everyone who is facing hardships of any kind at this time. We are doing well given the circumstances. I think Carson misses his daycare, and we all miss our activities and friends, but with FaceTime, walks in the neighborhood, and attempts at coming up with fun toddler activities, we are getting by just fine."

It is a scary time to be giving birth for many reasons, but we are thrilled to meet Baby Boy #2 tomorrow and get safely back home. We have actually had a few hospital visits for blood pressure scares over the past couple weeks. In fact, last Monday, I was all settled in a hospital bed about to be induced when we realized baby had flipped from a head-down position the previous week into a breech position. After a long discussion with the doctors, it was decided that we would go home and give baby a few days to flip back down. I've been doing lots of at-home \"flipping\" exercises, including laying upside down on an ironing board leaned against the couch, and apparently they worked because an ultrasound on Friday confirmed that baby had flipped! I am just praying that he stays that way through tomorrow morning!"
