It helps me to motivate myself to not be as lazy as my cat Banana (pictured above) - which is very tempting to do."

This book won't apply to everyone - it really is mostly for people who don't enjoy their jobs or are looking for a way to free up their time to pursue things other than their career. Also, he places very little value on his relationships with other people in the workplace; his co-workers are portrayed mostly as an inconvenience and a nuisance. Again, I enjoyed the ideas in the book because I always love to hear different views on work and career, and Ferriss offers a very unique and different view along with great advice on time management, efficiency, and starting your own business."
