We have lived in DC for three great years now, and we have loved it, but it is time for us to get back to the South, our families, and Tex-Mex. :) We will be living in Austin, so it will still be a fun new city for us to make our own, but we will be much closer to our families. I will be transferring offices within my current company, and Daniel will be leading a web development team at a digital strategy firm. We have no idea where in Austin we will be living, so any suggestions or tips from any of you who may know would be great! We leave DC mid-December, and we both start our jobs there in January."

I'm nervous that we haven't started putting anything in boxes yet, but our moving supplies should arrive in the mail on Saturday, and then we will need to seriously hit the ground running!"
