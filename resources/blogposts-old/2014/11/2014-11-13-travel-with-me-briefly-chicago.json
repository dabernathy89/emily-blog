We were able to walk nearly everywhere that we wanted to go in the city, but the hotel was close enough to train stations for the couple of times we went further out. The hotel offered a free breakfast each morning; however, we never had the breakfast because there were too many restaurants that we wanted to try in the city. The only real complaint I have is that the elevators are extremely slow which caused almost everyone to have to wait 15+ minutes for an elevator that was not already filled to the brim. The long wait caused many people to give up and take the stairs which caused the elevator to stop on almost every floor on the way down even when people were no longer there. For a building so tall, they really need a more efficient elevator system because many people cannot walk numerous flights of stairs. However, the view from the room and the location were so great that I have to give the hotel a rating of "

I wish I could try all the flavors!

The detail of the exhibits was phenomenal. Minatures exhibits is such a neat art form - the creator has to know their history very well on top of being creative and talented."

This was almost two months before, so I thought I might have been calling TOO early; however, the waitress first told me they were booked up and then noticed that there had a been a cancellation, so we were able to snag an 8:30pm reservation. So, even two months in advance was almost not early enough for a weekend reservation at this place!"
