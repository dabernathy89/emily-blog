Ever since Daniel and I celebrated our first anniversary in Orlando back in 2012, we have collected a Starbucks mug each time we take a trip together. You will notice that there are two types of mugs in the pictures below. We started out by collecting the Global Icon series. Starbucks has since discontinued this series in the U.S., so we now collect the new You Are Here series. To make it a bit more confusing, the You Are Here series is only in the U.S., and the Global Icon series is still sold overseas. The point of all this is to explain why we have a mix. Anyway, now it's time for you to join me on a trip down memory lane as I talk about our collection!"

I have mixed feelings about this mug because I somewhat associate it with work, but I bought it to remember the time that my company flew my husband out to stay with me to make up for the fact that they had extended my three day trip into a two week trip. While most of the time Daniel was just working in the hotel room and waiting for me to get back to the room at 2am, Daniel and I were able to enjoy one Sunday together doing some sightseeing, so I really enjoy remembering that day when I use this mug."
