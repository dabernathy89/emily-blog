After wandering through the left side of the maze of gardens, we kept on walking until we reach the Grand Trianon and the Petit Trianon. The Grand Trianon was built by King Louis XIV as a retreat for his family away from the business of the palace. The Petit Trianon was originally built for the mistress of King Louis IV, but it eventually became the exclusive home of Marie Antoinette. Both of these historic sites allow you to freely walk throughout the rooms to read posted information and explore. After running into many more enjoyable surprises in the gardens, we walked to our final destination in the very back of the gardens - Marie Antoinette's Hamlet and farm. The Hamlet looks like something straight out of a fairy tale. Marie Antoinette had the Hamlet built to provide yet another escape for herself in a farm and country setting. The farm is still running today - one lucky family actually lives there and takes care of the animals! Sign me up for that job! Actually, since our visit, Daniel tells me all the time that we should build and run a bed and breakfast modeled after the Hamlet. Not a bad idea!"
