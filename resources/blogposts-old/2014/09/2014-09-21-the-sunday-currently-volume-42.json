The restaurant had not opened yet, but they hosted an event for people to come and try out the food. We got a free lunch out of it, and overall, we really enjoyed the food! Afterward, I got my hair trimmed and styled and then headed into DC to join Daniel at his office happy hour. It was fun to hang out with his co-workers - I rarely get the opportunity to do that. For dinner, we had reservations at Old Ebbitt Grill, a restaurant in DC that we had been trying to go to together for a long time. Our food was delicious, but the most exciting part was probably the fact that someone hopped the fence in front of the White House and ran into the front door while we were eating. No, we didn't see it happen, but it is weird to think that that happened while we were just a couple blocks away!"
