Somehow, through the craziness of job, I had been able to keep up with regular posting.....until this busy season. This one was crazy on a whole other level. This one required sitting at my computer at the office for 15-18 hours several days in a row (including last weekend). There was hardly any time for me to eat three meals and hug my husband hello, so I definitely did not have time to write posts. This is why I should be pre-writing some posts - for times like these. But I'm terrible at that. Maybe now I will have learned my lesson and can get a few posts pre-written."
