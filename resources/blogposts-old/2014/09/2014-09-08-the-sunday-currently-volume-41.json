Saturday I woke up early to get as much work done as I could before I left to go to the Ed Sheeran concert with some friends. The concert was so great and just what I needed to forget about work. Right before the concert started, a huge storm came through and soaked the ground. Since we had lawn tickets, the area where we would have put our blankets was too muddy, so we just embraced the rain, mud, and chance to stand and dance the whole time! It was so fun. Because of the weather, I didn't bring my phone into the concert, so I have no pictures. I'm really sad about this - I love to document everything! The fun memories in my head will just have to do. This morning I worked and then went to brunch with friends and then came home to work some more for the rest of the day. For those of you that may be new here, no, I don't always work this much - I'm a CPA, and we have a big deadline on September 15th. I'll be back to normal life (and hopefully more interesting posts) soon enough!"
