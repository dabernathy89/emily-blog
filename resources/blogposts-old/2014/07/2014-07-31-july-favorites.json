The focus of the movie is on creating music and the relationships (both love and friendship) that form between the characters. Also, the soundtrack to the movie is fantastic. While the movie is only showing in select theaters, I highly recommend trying to get out and see it! But if you can't go to the theater, it would also be a good one to watch at home once the DVD comes out."

Her response was just \"Its a 10 Leave-In Conditioner Plus Kertain\". So, I picked up a bottle this month, and she is right! My hair is not nearly as damaged as it would normally be at this point between trims, and I feel like it is growing faster."
