    "excerpt": "This morning, I left home (DC) for Atlanta on a 7am flight for a work meeting. Three hours ago I was already back home on my couch! Needless to say, it has been a long day of travel, so this will be short and sweet.  Each week, I link up with The Nectar Collective to join the community of bloggers who share their goals for the week. I'm continuing to update my goals for the entire month of July rather than having a new set of goals each week. Right now, thinking about my to-dos in this big picture format has been working the best for me. I'm consider changing the format up yet again sometime soon to give updates only twice a month because they are obviously repetitive, and I think reporting updates on the same goals four times a month is a bit excessive.<br/>"
