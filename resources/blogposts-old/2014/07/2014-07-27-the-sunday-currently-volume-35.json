This weekend we drove down to Wake Forest, NC (which is near Raleigh) to visit my cousin Josh and his wife Meredith. We had a blast! Friday we drove down right after work. It took about five hours with all of the traffic, but we still managed to make it to Wake Forest by 11pm, so we talked to the Josh and Meredith a couple of hours before heading to bed. Saturday we went out for breakfast at a cute cafe in Raleigh called The Morning Times before heading to a tour of the North Carolina Capitol building."
