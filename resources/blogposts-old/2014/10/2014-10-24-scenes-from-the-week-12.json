We decided to apply now because we are taking a couple of domestic flights soon, and once you get your Global Entry pass, you also get TSA PreCheck which allows you to basically skip the security line at any airport that participates. The Global Entry pass costs $100 and is good for five years! I'm very excited to have easier travel over the next few years. :)"
