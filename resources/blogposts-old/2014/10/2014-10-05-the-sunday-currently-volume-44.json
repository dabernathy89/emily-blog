After showering, we cleaned up around the apartment and got a few things done before heading into DC to have dinner at Hill Country! This is a Texas BBQ restuarant with a really fun atmosphere. Daniel found a Travelzoo deal that got us a whole lot of food for a significant discount.  It was so good!"

We had never been before because it is a bit of a drive from where we live, but we have wanted to ever since we heard about it. It was a great little shop full of all kinds of books. There was a heavy emphasis on political and history books as well as biographies - while I don't typically read books like that (I wish I did!), those are Daniel's books of choice, so he was in paradise. After making a few selections (an early start to Christmas shopping), we headed to the bookstore coffee shop to read for an hour."
