When I discovered these white chocolate options (yes, I do like white chocolate, but I'm told it doesn't count), I immediately had to try them. Finally, I have a peanut-butter filled option that I enjoy! I love both of these - especially the Reese's Cups, and I hope to snag some more soon this fall!"

Recently, I discovered theSkimm, and I feel very well-informed now! theSkimm sends you an email in the mornings five days a week with a summary of current events from the day before. I'm not really sure how they fit everything in, but they cover all of the important things that are happening internationally and in the US. The emails are a perfect length, so I'm able to read it before I start each work day in five minutes or less. If you want to keep up with current events but get overwhelmed by news websites, I definitely recommend this resource. It has made a huge difference for me."
