I'm still very new to it, but I'm getting better, and in addition to purchasing a few new options, I'm reaching for colors I already have but have not used much. I already had this berry color - it was given to me by my friend Shannon for us bridesmaids to wear at her wedding. I put it on a couple of weeks ago for the first time since the wedding in June, and I love it! It seems to have a much higher staying power than the Essie or Sephora X polishes I have tried, but about the same as OPI. The color is beautiful and great for the fall/winter season!"

I still think that concealer works great, but I was getting really tired of having to contact a Mary Kay specialist and arrange to pick it up from them. So, I decided to try out a new drugstore concealer, and I'm very impressed by this one! It works just as well as the Mary Kay product, and it is a great price. I highly recommend it."

However, I do love white chocolate (I'm told it doesn't count as chocolate), so discovering these at a gas station this month was so exciting! I've always felt like I've somewhat missed out by not liking any chocolate, but now that I have peanut butter cups that I can enjoy, I'm satisfied. I bought the bag pictured above in celebration of Halloween this week. :)"
