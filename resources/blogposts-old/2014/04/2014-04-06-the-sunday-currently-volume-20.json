Later, after running more errands, we went out to celebrate a friend's birthday, and then Daniel convinced me to see the new Captain America, so we did. I'm not sure why I wasn't that interested in this one - I just felt like I wouldn't really enjoy it, and I was right. I thought it was kind of boring, but Daniel loved it."
