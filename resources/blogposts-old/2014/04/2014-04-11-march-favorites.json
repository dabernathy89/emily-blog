I can definitely tell a difference on in my skin - it's clearer, and I don't get as many dry patches as I used to. The picture actually shows the Restore & Renew night cream (rather than the Lift & Luminate). I ran out of my first container of the L&L, so I decided to try the R&R version. I definitely prefer the Life & Luminate because my skin feels much more oily in the morning after applying the Restore & Renew. I'll be switching back after I finish this one."
