It was difficult for me to get a day off of work during the middle of busy season, but I made it happen because I was so drawn to the ideas and message of the conference. As the title of this post suggests, the Blue Conference is designed to facilitate conversations about a movement to restore culture - using our vocations that are a part of a specific channel of culture to do our part to bring the story and work of God into the world. The seven channels of culture that the conference offered were business, government, arts & entertainment, media, church, social, and education."

For example, he believes that instead of creating a \"Christian\" movie that will bring in a limited audience, it is better to create a great movie that asks great questions without the Christian label so that it will bring in a wide range of people. \"We need excellence in our work that shocks culture.\" Great stories are about the journey (or the process) rather than the ending because the journey is what excites us."

He asked the question, \"How do we feed the world in a way that honors God?\" The points he made about the system that creates the food that we eat were incredibly interesting, and I am definitely hoping to read some more books on this topic. But the part of his discussion that impacted me the most was his introduction about work in general. Work is integral, not incidental, to God's work in the world, and the goal of work is to take care of those God has placed in front of you. When figuring out our passion and work in the world, he suggests that we should look for brokenness - a wrong that needs to be righted. For Hans this meant helping to right some wrongs in the food production system by opening up Elevation Burger, which offers organic, grass-fed beef."
