We went to a Nat's game Thursday, and on Saturday, we took him to one of our favorite brunch spots in the afternoon, and he got to meet a lot of our friends at a housewarming party that evening. Before the party, Daniel and Jacob went out to do a brewery tour, and my friend Amanda came over to bake a very special cake! She had the fantastic idea to make a cake shaped like a house, and so we did (see above)! It was really fun to make, and everyone seemed to like it - especially the hosts of the party (Lauren & Dave)!"
