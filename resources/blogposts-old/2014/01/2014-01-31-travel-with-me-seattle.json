The menus even said that they were printed with organic ink (whatever that means...). The brunch menu was phenomenal. Just look at the picture of  my pancakes below! They had a pancakes toppings bar with all kinds of fruit, peanut butter, fresh whipped cream, and more. Daniel had a breakfast burrito and loved it as well. (Note from Daniel: the portion sizes where surprisingly enormous for a place that prides itself on sustainability. I'm guessing they feed the leftovers to the chickens out back.)"

I would consider this to be one of the best coffee places I've visited. As you can see in the picture below, it is a Cuban place, so in addition to coffee, they serve Cuban appetizers and pastries. I had a latte, Daniel had a Cuban coffee, and we shared a delicious empanada! We would have had more if we weren't waiting our turn for a table at the next restaurant below.... The only weird thing about this place is that it was pretty empty, and we didn't like that it closes really early in the day. We had to plan to go there before dinner because it would have been closed afterward."

This restaurant was similar to a tapas place - there aren't really any full entrees, so you are meant to order several things to share with the table. We ended up splurging because we could not turn down the drink, appetizer, large plate, or dessert options we were given. Everything was fresh and unique. If you are ever in the Queen Anne area of Seattle looking for a nicer restaurant, please eat here!"

There were SO many options (many very, very good), that it made it hard to figure out what would be good to try or what the restaurant was even known for. Whenever we got up to serve ourselves at the buffet, it was crowded and over-whelming. We did try crab legs for the first time which was a fun experience...."

That's not unusual for us even in normal, everyday life, but we had to try several options in a city so well-known for its coffee drinkers and coffee shops. Tully's Coffee is a place we had never heard of before planning our trip here, so we wanted to try it. It was fine - the coffee was good and so was the customer service, but it's a pretty wide-spread chain and it definitely felt like a chain when we were sitting inside. I don't have much against the place, but if I'm going to drink coffee from a chain, I'd rather have Starbucks or Caribou Coffee."
