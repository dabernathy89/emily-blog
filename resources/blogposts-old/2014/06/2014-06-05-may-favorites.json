Each chapter is an independent story or essay, and it's a quick read. Shauna discusses friendship, loves, loss, food, sadness, the home, etc. If you have never read any of Shauna's books, I highly recommend you pick up this one or "

I'll be writing more about this restaurant in one of my trip re-cap posts (in the near future), but the food was fantastic, the waiters were so nice and passionate about their food and their restaurant, and the ambience was very romantic. If you have plans to go to Paris, PLEASE make a reservation at Bistrotters."

I picked up this Urban Decay eye pencil at Sephora. This was such a great purchase! Just like all of the reviews say, this pencil is very easy to apply because it is creamy and easy to control when applying. I rarely ever have to smudge around the line or correct anything with a cotton ball, but when I do, it's a very easy fix because it is easy to wipe away for about 30 seconds after application, but after that, it sticks and won't budge for the rest of the day (hence the 24/7)."

We didn't have cell phone service at all while in Europe, so this was the perfect choice for us. I highly recommend this even if you will have cell service when traveling because the pinning and list feature is so useful!"
