In the past, I've been following the way that Melyssa (blogger at The Nectar Collective) does her Weekly Wishes - one set of monthly goals at the beginning of the month and then a new set of weekly goals at the beginning of each week. I found that I was forgetting my monthly goals nearly every month because I was focusing so much on my weekly goals. Now I'd like to use my Monday post to basically just track my goals for the entire month, and I might add in a new goal here and there if there is something else I want to get done. But I'm tired of disappointing myself by setting too many goals, so I think that this will work better for me. We shall see! With all of that said, here are my goals for June as well as the progress I have made on them."
