I'm not complaining - we have been traveling a ton (my favorite), but it has been nice to have a bit more of a weekend routine this time around. Well, sort of... We went camping Friday night at Prince William Forest park, but it was a quick little outing. We left Friday right after work, set up camp, made dinner and breakfast over the fire, did some hiking, and we were home by 3 yesterday. Ever since then, we have just hung out at home, gone to church, and crossed some errands off of our list. This weekend has felt long and stretched out in the best of ways!"
