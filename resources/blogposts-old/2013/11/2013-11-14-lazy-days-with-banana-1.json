We adopted him a little over a year ago, and he came to us with the name Banana. At first, we were hesitant and wanted to change his name, but then it grew on us. Now I absolutely love how his name makes people chuckle, and it just seems to suit him in an unexplainable way."

He acts much like a dog - begging for cuddles and people food, waiting at the door for us to come home from work, and always striving to be the center of attention.  He is also quite fat and loves to eat plastic and lick windows. He is a strange one. But we love him!"
