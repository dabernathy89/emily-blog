I was not about to let this opportunity slip past me again this year, so my husband and I declared the weekend of November 1st our “fall weekend.”  We escaped into the mountains of southern Virginia to a B&B in the middle of nowhere. We enjoyed the incredible colors of fall that surrounded us while completely unplugged from the busyness off life (literally – our B&B had no internet or TV in the room). Parts of Saturday and Sunday we drove about two-thirds of Skyline Drive, and we have the most fantastic pictures. At some of the look-out points, I felt like I was staring down at a vibrant water-color painting. It was just breath-taking."
