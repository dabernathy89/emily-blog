The world was still dealing with the huge impact of COVID, we experienced tremendous loss within our family and friends, and I was diagnosed with a little-understood condition (PPPD) that has led to many days of sickness and discomfort. But there were some beautiful moments, and writing these posts always reminds me of how much I have to be thankful for.  And now that we have already made it through about a quarter of 2022, the world has seen such tragedy again. World events like these remind me to pray for peace, cling to Jesus, snuggle our babies, and be incredibly grateful for the blessings of freedom, comfort, and peace we have at home."
