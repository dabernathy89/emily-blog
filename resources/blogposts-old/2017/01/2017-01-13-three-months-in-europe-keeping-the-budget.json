In order to go on this trip, I took a leave of absence from my job as a CPA at a Big Four accounting firm. My husband is a freelance web developer, so he was able to pick a few projects to bring with him but still had the flexibility to turn down new projects for a few months. We paid for our trip through savings, through the couple of projects that Daniel brought along with him, and through travel points and miles redemptions. As expected, we had to stick with a fairly tight budget while traveling for this extended amount of time. This was easier to do in some countries (Italy) than others (Switzerland)."

We definitely would have stayed in hostels if we didn't have so many hotel points or if we couldn't find an Airbnb that wasn't a good deal, but we just never had the financial need to forego our own place in an Airbnb/hotel for a bed in a hostel. I have nothing against hostels, but I do think it is possible to backpack Europe on a budget without having to stay in them."

For example, in Switzerland (aka the most expensive country ever), we paid a large amount of money to take a cable car between different mountaintop villages. It was an all-day activity and one of our favorite excursions on the trip. However, because Switzerland is SO EXPENSIVE, we weren't able to do many other paid-for activities during our ten days there. We loved Switzerland, but we will definitely need to go back when we have a higher activity budget on a shorter trip."
