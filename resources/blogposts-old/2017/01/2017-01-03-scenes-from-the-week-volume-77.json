Daniel and I have decided to try out Whole30 for the month of January. If you aren't familiar, Whole30 is a clean eating plan that requires you to exclude sugar, grains, dairy, and legumes from your meals. We have friends who have done this and have seen positive results (primarily, a boost in energy which I desperately need), so we are curious to give it a shot. Day 1 went well, but I'm sure I'll start missing cheese, pasta, and my daily bowl of cereal before too long!"

El Alma has a gorgeous rooftop patio with a view of the Austin skyline, and I had read that you can see the 10pm Austin fireworks show from there. Well, we were lucky enough to get patio seating with the perfect view of the show! We ate our dinner and then were able to enjoy the fireworks without even moving from our table. We are thinking this could become an annual tradition! After dinner we all went back to our apartment where my sister and her boyfriend joined, and we watched the NYE concerts on TV and counted down to 2017!"
