We actually tried to avoid shopping for Ikea furniture this time around like we've always done, but Ikea is the only place we could find the exact type of bed we wanted. Our guest room is tiny and also acts as Daniel's office everyday (he works from home), so we didn't want to fill it up with a king- or queen-sized bed that takes up most of the space. We wanted a bed that takes up the space of a twin and turns into a king when we have guests, but we were not interested in a trundle bed. While I don't love the style of the bed we got, it does exactly what we wanted. Once it was built, I grew to like it even more! It has drawer space underneath, and to turn it into a king bed, all you have to do is pull out the bottom and move the top mattress (that's currently sitting on top of the bottom mattress) onto the part you pulled out. We love it! I picked this flat gray bedding for the twin size, but we have a cozy white duvet for the king size."

But right after I took this picture, something scary happened. Daniel hates needles, so whenever the nurse put in his IV, he started to feel really light-headed. The nurse stepped out for a minute, and I heard Daniel say \"Woah!\" and then make a strange noise. I walked over to him, and he began shaking like he was having a seizure. Of course, I yelled for help, and eight or nine nurses ran in to help. It ends up that he had passed out from a very low heart heart, and apparently seizure-like symptoms can happen sometimes when a person passes out (I had no idea!). He is fine, but they wanted him to get checked out by the cardiologist and run some tests, so we ended up waiting in the hospital for a long time. His surgery went well, and we did basically nothing the whole weekend while he healed up."
