We went to the coffee shop Tuesday night and did some calendar planning for the year and then watched one of the shows. It's a cute, 15-minute light show that moves around to the music. It's actually a really impressive thing for a local coffee shop to do! I recommend it if you are ever in town around the holidays."

Over the weekend, I gave it to them, and they immediately hung it up. I think it's so cute! I designed it on Collage.com, and I was very impressed with the service. I couldn't find another website where you could design any number of photos you wanted into a collage in basically any design you wanted. I'm not sponsored at all or anything, but if you want to do a project where you have a specific number of photos that don't fit in with one of the standard collage templates (like for 30 photos in our case), Collage.com is a great resource! They always seem to be having good sales too."

It actually hasn't been that hard because we've been good about creating some delicious Whole30-approved meals at home. My entire life I've eaten a bowl of cereal for breakfast, so making time to cook breakfast in the morning has been the hardest part. I know my fried egg isn't beautiful, and neither are my avocado slices, but this picture shows what I've been eating for breakfast in the mornings. Some days I'll have an apple with almond butter instead of avocado and bacon."
