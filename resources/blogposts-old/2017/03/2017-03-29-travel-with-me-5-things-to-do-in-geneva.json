Some of the exhibits were closed due to construction, but we were able to see most of main exhibits showcasing watches that ranged from antiques to modern-day. Unfortunately, we couldn't read anything because it was all in French, and we had just missed the daily afternoon English tour, but it was still a fascinating way to experience an important part of Swiss culture."
