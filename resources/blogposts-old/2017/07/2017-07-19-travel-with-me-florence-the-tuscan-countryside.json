The Tuscany I had seen in movies and read about in books seemed to offer many of my favorite things: pasta, cheese, wine, culture, a slower life pace (la dolce vita!), etc. I was so looking forward to diving in! We spent three nights in Florence (including one day touring the countryside), and we were very happy with how we spent our time, so I wanted to share it as an ideal three-night itinerary for travelers with similar interests."

We were lucky to be able to grab two spots at the bar in Il Santino Gastronomia, because this little eatery was packed! The bar seats gave us a view of all the food being prepped, and we were able to chat with servers as we ate. While the photo below isn't the best quality, I wanted to share and point out the meats hanging in the back, the warm, ready-to-slice bread on the cutting board, and the fresh local herbs on the bottom left. ?"

Masterpieces created by Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo, and numerous others are showcased in a beautifully designed set of exhibits.  The museum is closed on Mondays, so keep that in mind, but it stays open until about 7pm the rest of the week. During the summer, they offer some extended hours until 10pm, so check the website before going. Not many museums in Europe are open that late, so it's a good way to get your visit in even if you have a busy morning and afternoon already planned. Keep in mind that Uffizi is a large museum - we didn't allow much time for our visit, so we weren't able to see everything."
