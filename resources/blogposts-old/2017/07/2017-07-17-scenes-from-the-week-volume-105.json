It was great to get together with such a fun group and see the people who had left my company awhile ago. As of now, only four of us in this photo still currently work for EY (one is me),  and one of those three has their last day this coming Friday.  I get so sad when friends leave my company, but I'm very excited for them to explore new opportunities. By the way, Red Ash has an amazing happy hour with great deals on delicious Italian dishes!"
