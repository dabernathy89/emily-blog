I often consider July and August to be my least favorite months of the year (because of the heat), but I'm determined to enjoy them this year and live them to the fullest. We have several fun things coming up, so that will make it even easier to savor these hot months! This weekend we got off to a great start by going to Waco for one night to do the Waco Escape Room for a belated Fathers' Day celebration! All three of us sisters and my brother were there in addition to my husband and both Ellen and Elizabeth's boyfriends. We joked that my brother Ben was the ninth wheel, but he didn't seem to mind. :) Saturday Ellen and her boyfriend Lane stayed with us after going to a wedding in Austin, and we had a great time together."
