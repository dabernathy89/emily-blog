Daniel had a conference, so we took advantage of the one free plane ticket and made a trip out of it. We went several days before the conference and got in a full four-day weekend in NYC. While we have been to NYC several times together, there are always endless things to do, and we will never get tired of going. I came back home to Austin this past Tuesday morning, and Daniel came back Thursday night after his conference was over."

When I was younger, I watched the movie and sang the songs over and over, so I couldn't wait to hear the music live on stage. I tried to keep my expectations low since the musical is new and had mixed reviews, but both Daniel and I loved it. The music, singing, and dancing were all wonderful, and it was very true to the movie. The one major difference from the movie is that they completely removed the evil Rasputin character and replaced him with a much more realistic \"villain\", a change I was happy to see since I never liked Rasputin and his dancing demon sidekicks in the movie. We hung around outside the theater for a few minutes after the show and got to see a couple of the actors leave the theater, most notably, the adorable little girl who played young Anastasia!"

It was great to spend time with all of them all while doing some fun things around my city. We had lunch at the Oasis and then went to the 360 Bridge viewpoint (pictured here). Then we went for some yummy, refreshing gelato at Dolce Neve to cool off - it got up to 105 degrees in Austin this day!"
