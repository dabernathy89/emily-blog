As I've mentioned in some of my other posts, Switzerland is very expensive, and we weren't prepared to face that on our backpacker budget. We allowed ourselves several splurges in "

They sent us to The Bite, a burger place in the city. This was an interesting cultural experience because not only was the restaurant nearly a half hour walk away (which was fine since we were able to explore the city, but it was SO COLD!), but it was also definitely NOT cheap. When we looked at the menu and saw that the cheapest burger was $25, we tried to find something cheaper nearby, but we couldn't find anything. Yes, we could have gone back to the grocery store for dinner, but we had already done that for lunch that day and for dinner the night before, so we just went for it. The burgers were incredible, and it was a great, local atmosphere, but be prepared to shell out $25 and more if you go to The Bite! While a backpacker budget probably wouldn't usually include a meal like this, it seemed to us that this is about as cheap as a sit-down dinner in Zurich gets!"

I do still recommend the tour as a way to see parts of the city you probably wouldn't know to go to otherwise. Other than wandering the gorgeous downtown streets, we also stopped at the Fraumünster, a church famous for housing Chagell's Church Windows (no photos allowed inside, but they are beautiful!), and we stopped to take photos of the city view from Lindenhof Square. The Free Walk Zurich Downtown tour is only 1.5 hours, but it covers a lot of ground! It starts every day at 11am."

Once we arrived, it was a little stressful trying to figure out where to go. We found ourselves going in and out of the (very) fancy hotel lobby, but we couldn't find the great viewpoint our guide told us about. We even asked the hotel concierge, and he directed us to a view of the city, but it was an obstructed view. It was still a nice trip up, but we don't know that we ever found the view our guide was talking about."
