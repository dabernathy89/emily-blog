I think it may have something to do with the excitement of Baby Boy's arrival next year and knowing that this is our last Christmas as a family of two. I'm so thankful for this time of year: celebrating the birth of Jesus, spending time with friends and family, sending out Christmas cards, enjoying out Christmas tree and "

We also made a quick stop at BookPeople to browse the children's section, which was so much fun!
