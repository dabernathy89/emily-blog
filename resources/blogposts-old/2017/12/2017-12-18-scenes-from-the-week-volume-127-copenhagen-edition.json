It is the second oldest one in the world, and it is a magical Christmas wonderland this time of year. If Santa had an amusement park on the North Pole, this is what it would be like. Every little detail of the park felt like it was taken out of a whimsical fariytale. We weren't able to ride many rides because I'm pregnant, but we did do one adorable ride that takes you in a moving trunk through sets of fairytales by Hans Christian Andersen. There was Christmas magic around every corner!"
