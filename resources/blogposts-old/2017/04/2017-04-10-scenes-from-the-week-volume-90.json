Bones has been a part of my life since Daniel and I had our first married summer six years ago. We used to watch regularly, but then we took a couple seasons off. When I heard they were ending the show, I decided to watch the final season, and Daniel joined me for the finale. The finale did a great job finalizing the story for all of the characters. My favorite parts were the shout out to Sweets, a favorite character who they killed off in a previous season, and a scene where Hodgins is going through old things and pulls out a photo of him and Zach from their Christmas at the Jeffersonian, an episode from the first season that I've always claimed as my favorite. I won't go into the details of Big Little Lies as it's a short seven-episode mini series, and I don't want to give anything away, but the last episode is SO GOOD."
