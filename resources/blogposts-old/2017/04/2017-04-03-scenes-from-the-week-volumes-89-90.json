They also have an herb garden you can look at and a cute photo booth and gazebo in the back. Once we sat down for dinner, we really enjoyed the French food and felt it was very authentic.

Your price depends on the \"coffee tier\" - basic, deluxe, or exclusive - and the frequency of delivery you select. I signed up for one bag of \"deluxe\" beans per month. When signing up, you tell them all sorts of details about the type of coffee you prefer and how you brew at home, and they take that information and choose a bag of beans from one of over 40 roasters from around the country. What really drew me to the service is the list of roasters that they use - they use several smaller roasters that I've tried and enjoyed on some trips the past couple of years (such as Good Folks Coffee, Panther Coffee, and La Colombe). Also the website interface is beautiful and easy to use, and you can see which coffee they have selected for you and track when it will be roasted and shipped. You can also ask for specific roasters and such. I'm not sponsored at all - I just really enjoy this box!"
