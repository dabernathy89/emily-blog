Blues on the Green is a summer concert series at Zilker Park here in Austin, and last week was the last one of the year. We picked the perfect night to go - it was 82 degrees with a light breeze and cloud cover (perfect after the weekend of 107 degree days last week!). We got there an hour early, so we were able to snag a decent spot and grab some food at the vendors. Our friends John and Amber came to join us right when the show started. It was a great summer night!"

Saturday night we went to another Texas Monthly Top 50 BBQ Restaurant (The Pit Room) for dinner and then headed out to Houston's White Linen Night, an arts festival. Everyone wears white and walks through some of the artsy districts of the city, and the streets are filled with arts, crafts, and food vendors. It was fun to people watch and get a glimpse of the art featured and on sale."

Because we were only gone for one night, we didn't have anyone come by and visit Banana (our cat) while we were gone, so we set up the BananaCam so that we could see what he does while we are gone. The camera is connected to an app, so it was very easy to use. It wasn't very exciting. He just slept the whole time! But it was fun to check in occasionally and see what he was up to (in the above picture, he is in the top left corner asleep)."
