At the same time, a natural calm fills the streets of this stunning Tuscan hill town that forces you to relax and enjoy."

All we knew is that it was a beautiful town in Tuscany with a rich history and an abundance of sights to see. I'm so glad that we visited. Based on that visit, here are seven things that I recommend you should do on your trip to Siena."

Although it was built at the same time as the rest of the Cathedral, it wasn't rediscovered until 1999 during routine maintenance.  Today, the public can enter and enjoy these long-hidden frescoes telling different New Testament stories. Apparently there used to be a series of frescoes telling the Old Testament story, but those have since been destroyed."
