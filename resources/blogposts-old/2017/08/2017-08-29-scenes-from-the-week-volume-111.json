The exterior of the church is magnificent, but my jaw nearly dropped when we walked inside and saw the interior! After seeing so many cathedrals and basilicas in Europe, I didn't think it was possible to be impressed by the interior of a church again, but, man, was I wrong! What made this church unique is the incredible lighting in every corner, but on top of that, it also has the intricate architectural and sculptural details and stained glass windows that I was so impressed with in the cathedrals in Europe. We toured the basilica during the morning, but then we went back in the afternoon for a wonderful organ concert where the very talented organist played movie music."
