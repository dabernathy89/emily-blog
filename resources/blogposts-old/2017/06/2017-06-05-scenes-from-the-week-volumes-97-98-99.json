Christina, my cousin's new wife, is from a Greek family. The wedding was a Greek Orthodox ceremony, and there was lots of Greek dancing at the reception. It was fun to try it out but even more fun to watch. My favorite part of the reception was dancing with my other cousin's little two-year-old son! He was getting really into his little dance moves and would not stop holding my hand!"

It is very much a foodie town, so we ate several wonderful meals, took a food tour, and went to some breweries. We also visited the Biltmore and took an audio tour of the mansion and a nice long walk through the gardens. On our last morning, we drove a part of the Blue Ridge Parkway to take in the gorgeous green mountain scenery (pictured here). It was great to get away and enjoy some history, food, and nature together in Asheville."
