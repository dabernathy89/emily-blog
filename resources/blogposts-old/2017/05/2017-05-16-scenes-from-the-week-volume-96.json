Usually we are on a trip at this time of year, but this year, we are taking fewer trips and decided to celebrate with a staycation. Friday Daniel surprised me with a full day of activities to celebrate my birthday which included a trip to the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, hand and foot massages, pizza at Pieous, a special tasting at The Infinite Monkey Theorem Winery, and a cooking class! He really went all out, and we had so much fun. Saturday was more of a low-key day - we did some shopping on S Congress and met up with friends for dinner at Grizzelda's. Unfortuantely we didn't get to go visit either of our mothers for Mothers' Day on Sunday, but we sent them our love in the form of gifts, cards, and phone calls. We celebrated our anniversary Sunday night with dinner at Clark's Oyster Bar. Monday we drove out to Texas Wine Country and enjoyed the nice weather and slower pace. Monday night I flew to Dallas for a work training for the rest of the week."

We know nothing about the different varieties of oysters, so we had the waitress pick for us. She gave us some from Massachusetts, some from California, and some from Canada. We are excited to say we are now oyster fans! I liked the ones from Massachusetts the best because they are larger and saltier. Yum!"
