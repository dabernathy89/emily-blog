I thought I'd try and get back into the rhythm of blogging by just doing a quick catch up of all the things that have been going on these past six weeks. We have done a lot, so I'm only going to share bits and pieces."

Daniel was in a wedding in Los Angeles, so we flew to San Francisco the weekend before, spent a few days there, then started the drive down Highway 1 to LA. We stopped in many places along the way, including Half Moon Bay, Carmel-by-the-Sea, and Santa Barbara, and we stayed the night in Monterey and Pismo Beach. The trip was wonderful but exhausting as we spent all day everyday exploring, and then I spent late nights working, but it was so worth it to be able to see California for the first time! I'll definitely be sharing more on our trip in future travel posts."
