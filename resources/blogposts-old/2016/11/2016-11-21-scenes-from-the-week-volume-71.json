Relient K is Daniel's favorite band from growing up, and we go see them any time they come play where we live. This was our third time seeing them since we were married, and it was Daniel's tenth time to see them himself. They put on another great show. Switchfoot also gave a great performance. They ended their set playing \"Dare You to Move\", one of my favorite songs ever (\"A Walk to Remember\" soundtrack, anyone??)."

We don't usually decorate before Thanksgiving, but we are going to be traveling over Thanksgiving Weekend, and I'm turning right around and flying to Orlando the next Monday morning for a week-long work training. We decided to get the decorations out, so they are all set for the Christmas season after Thanksgiving. One very exciting thing for us this year is that we upgraded our Christmas tree! You may laugh when you see the picture because it's still pretty small, but for the past five years, we have been using a little table-top tree I bought for my dorm room in college. We've always lived in small apartments, so we've been fine with the little tree, but I couldn't resist getting a bigger one while we were walking around the Christmas section at Target on Saturday. We haven't put the ornaments on the tree yet, but I'm so excited to do that Monday!"
