Well, we ran some numbers the next day and put a lot more thought into it. We are moving! And to top it all off, we are moving THIS Wednesday, AND I won't even be home to help. I'll be at a work training in Orlando, so Daniel is kind of on his own. We have movers coming to help with the big things and friends who have offered to help with the other stuff, so he is not really alone, but I definitely am getting the good end of the deal. We turn in the keys to our old place Friday morning, and I'll come home Thursday night to our apartment mostly moved out. We will see how it goes! We are very excited for the extra space and the good deal that we got, and it is nice that we are just moving units in the same apartment building."
