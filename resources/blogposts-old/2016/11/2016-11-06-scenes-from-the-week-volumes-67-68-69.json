After work calmed down, we had a friend stay with us (and I wanted to spend time with her, of course), hosted a party at our place, and then took off for a week-long trip to Portland/the Oregon Coast. It has been a lot of fun, but I am happy to say I am actually back to blogging."

While there, we picked up delicious Pine State Biscuits (and skipped the line we would have waited in at the actual restaurant) along with some road trip snacks for our drive to the Mt. Hood area later that day. The snacks included local cheese, sausage, apples, and bread."
