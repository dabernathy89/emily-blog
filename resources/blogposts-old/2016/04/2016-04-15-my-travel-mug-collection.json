It was very well received, and we have done a lot of traveling since that post, so I thought I'd do an updated version! Ever since Daniel and I celebrated our first anniversary in Orlando back in 2012, we have collected a Starbucks mug each time we take a trip together. You will notice that there are two types of mugs in the pictures below. We started out by collecting the Global Icon series. Starbucks has since discontinued this series in the U.S., so we now collect the new You Are Here series for U.S. destinations and the Global Icon series for international destinations. So it's time for you to join me on a trip down memory lane as I talk through our collection!"

While most of the time Daniel was just working in the hotel room and waiting for me to get back to the room at 2am, Daniel and I were able to enjoy one Sunday together doing some sightseeing, so I really enjoy remembering that day when I use this mug."
