My husband, on the other hand, takes a backpacking trip every year on the Appalachian Trail, so I definitely had him help me figure out what I needed to look for in a backpack. This bag is about as large as you can get for something you plan to have on your back for extended periods of time. However, I've never been a light packer, so preparing for packing in this bag before the trip was a challenge."

The rest of the time we traveled by train, and this bag was perfect for that type of travel."

I found the main backpack too heavy when I kept the daypack attached, so I mostly carried it by hand whenever wearing the larger backpack. I actually found this to be a more secure way to carry my valuables since I had them right in my hand rather than attached behind me. Also, the daypack has a slot for a laptop, so I was able to safely carry my Macbook Air around Europe."
