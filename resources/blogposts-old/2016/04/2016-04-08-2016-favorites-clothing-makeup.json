I thought they'd be fine, and I didn't want to spend money on shoes that would just wear out from all of the walking we planned to do. Well, the sole of those boots started to fall off on Christmas Eve! My husband actually still needed shoes too, so we both headed to the mall Christmas Eve afternoon. All I knew was I needed something that would be comfortable for walking thousands of steps every day, and it had to keep my feet warm for the European winter. As a bonus, I really wanted something that I could wear casually with jeans AND that I could wear with leggings and one dress I brought with me. Well, I found the perfect thing! The "

They were the only shoes I brought with me so that I didn't have to make room for shoes in my backpack. They are amazing! ECCO is a brand that specializes in being comfortable while still being stylish. The soles of these shoes formed perfectly to my feet. I rarely had aching feet which is amazing because we walked anywhere from 15,000 to 35,000 steps almost every day. While real leather isn't made to go through all of the snow and rain that we experienced (resulting in the wear and tear pictured above), the quality did allow the boot to stay in good walking condition throughout the whole three months, and I don't think fake leather shoes would have lasted."
