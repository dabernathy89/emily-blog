We had always heard that they had one of the best happy hours in town with low-priced sushi rolls, but we were never able to get there in time after work. Since this was my last week off from work, we took advantage and made reservations for happy hour, and it was great!"

We didn't eat until 1:30pm! I never would have gone if I'd known we would wait that long for lunch, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like this is something you have to check off your list if you live in Austin. Yes, the BBQ was incredible. It was the best we'd ever had! Daniel agrees, and he's a BBQ snob."
