The entire country of Ireland is stunning, but, in my opinion, the remote coastal towns are the most breathtaking. Because we did our trip in January, perhaps the least touristy month of all, we had most of the remote villages nearly to ourselves. This does come with some disadvantages such as closed restaurants and attractions along with bitterly cold weather, but there is a special beauty to not sharing the quiet coastal landscapes with crowds of other tourists."
