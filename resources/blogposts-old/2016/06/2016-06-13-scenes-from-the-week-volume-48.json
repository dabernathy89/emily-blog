Some of you may know that I have a little hobby called \"travel hacking\", and here is a quick tip that I just have to share. With the Hyatt credit card, you get one free night annually at any Hyatt hotel category 4 or below (out of 7 categories), and somehow the Andaz in Costa Rica is only a category 4, which makes this a travel hacker's paradise! We actually met several other people at the resort who were using their free nights as well. Daniel and I each have the Hyatt credit card which got us two free nights. (Actually, the best deal this credit card gives you is the two free nights in the first year at ANY of the Hyatt properties around the world. I haven't written about our stays with these free nights yet, but one day I will. We got two free nights at the Park Hyatt Vienna and two free nights at the Park Hyatt Milan, both VERY fancy hotels in fantastic locations.)"
