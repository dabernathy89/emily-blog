One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose."

Some of the group napped and rested at the hotel, and the rest of us went out and explored Llano. Little did I know that Llano had such cute little shops! This is a picture of Daniel, my sisters, and Jason walking next to the Llano dam with a cool bridge in the background."

Unfortunately, I couldn't fit both Daniel and the Cooper's name in the picture, but Daniel was so excited to visit his favorite restaurant of all time that I had to share. Even though we now have a Cooper's five minutes from our apartment in Austin, Daniel has memories of stopping at the Llano location on the way home from summer camp each year, so this is his favorite location. I actually thought that the brisket and ribs were better at this location too."
