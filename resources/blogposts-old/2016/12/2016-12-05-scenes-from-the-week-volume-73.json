The best part was Wednesday night when my company hosted an event at Universal Studios. After the park closed to the public, my company rented out the whole Islands of Adventure side for us. We could ride any rides, eat any food, and drink any drinks for free. They had a ton of extra food and drink booths set up along the walkways. All of the characters were there too! It was a lot of fun. My favorite parts were both in Harry Potter World (duh!): the free frozen butterbeer and the 15-minute-only wait for the Harry Potter castle ride! My co-workers and I were joking about how we aren't sure we can ever go to a theme park and pay for things again after this experience. It was so much fun!"
