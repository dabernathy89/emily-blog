Also,while going through the online check-in process, I look to see if any better seats have opened up for me to grab.

It is nice to already have a plan so that you aren't trying to look things up on your phone while dodging other travelers and juggling luggage. Have the address for your lodging handy and make sure to know ahead of time how long it should take to get there from the airport. If you are taking public transportation, have an idea of how to purchase a ticket and which type of ticket you should get. You can often get great transportation deals if you purchase multi-day passes, and ticket stations and self-service kiosks do not always lay out the best options in a way that's easy to look through for  quick purchase."

Prepare yourself to be flexible and go with the flow! You might be too tired to cram in one more \"must-see\" museum visit in your already packed day, or you may find you haven't allowed enough time to get all the way across town to your dinner reservation. That's okay! You can be spontaneous and fill in your time with other things, and these things often end up being the most memorable. You will have a much better time on your vacation if you let the details go."
