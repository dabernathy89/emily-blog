One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a scrapbook that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose."

We have tried to go before when there was a three-hour wait, so we were glad to hear it was only a fifteen minute wait this time around. Let me just say, we totally get the hype now! The food was soooo delicious. We split an benedict sampler and a pancake flight. This picture shows our pancake flight with our pancake flavor selection of pineapple upside down, blueberry danish, and french toast."
