According to the Castle's website, there has been a royal castle on Castle Rock (Edinburgh Castle's home) since at least the 12th century. St. Margaret's Chapel on the castle grounds was completed in the year 1140 and still stands today as the oldest building at the site. The Scots and the English took turns taking over the castle over the years. Mary Queen of Scots gave birth to her son James VI here. The Crown Jewels of Scotland were lost and found again here. I could go on and on...."
