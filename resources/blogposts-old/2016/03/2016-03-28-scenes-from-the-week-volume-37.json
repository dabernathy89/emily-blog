It was so great to see one of my favorite bands in such a pretty and historic venue. Not many people have heard of Explosions in the Sky, but you've heard them if you ever watched the TV show Friday Night Lights. They play most of the music in the show. They are an instrumental post-rock band from right here in Austin, and this show kicked off the start of their world tour. We really enjoyed it!"
