The museum has several very well-done exhibits. My favorites were the LBJ Oval Office replica, Lady Bird Johnson's real office left how it was the day she left (with a stunning view of Austin!), and the phone booths where you could listen to actual phone calls between LBJ and many important people such as Martin Luther King and Jacqueline Kennedy. I highly recommend this museum to anyone visiting Austin!"
