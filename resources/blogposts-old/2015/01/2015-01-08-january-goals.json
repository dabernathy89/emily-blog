I guess it's because the things that I want to work on in 2015 are the same as they have always been (read more, exercise more, work on Project Life more, travel more, save more, journal more, spend more time reading the Bible, etc, etc.). Since I've told myself constantly that I want to do these things through my monthly goal posts, it seems repetitive to put the same things into a 2015 goals post. But, even though I know I'm risking being repetitive on this blog, I still would like to continue monthly goal posts. I think monthly goals just make more sense for me right now than big goals for the entire year. So, let's jump on into what I hope to accomplish in what's left of the month of January!"
