I really enjoy sharing glimpses into our life in this space, and I love keeping a journal of what we do with our days. I thought I'd put together a post to catch up on life over the past three months. Even though I felt like I was working around the clock, we still managed to fit in quite a bit of fun. We are really trying to embrace the new city we live in and all it has to offer! And, as usual, we have even been able to fit in a few trips over the past couple months!"
