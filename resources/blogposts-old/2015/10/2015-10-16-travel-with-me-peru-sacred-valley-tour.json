Then, he whipped the car around, started frantically blinking his lights at other taxis heading that way, and pulled into an opening on the side of the road. Then, he grabbed our bags and said we were going to take a \"short\" walk into town. We were really confused at first and slightly nervous. But once we started walking, we noticed lights flashing at the entrance of the town, and our driver later told us that the police were collecting a tariff. I'm assuming that the tariff was more like a penalty for unlicensed drivers, but we will never know for sure."
