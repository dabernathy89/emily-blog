I was happy with what I brought along with me, so if you are planning a short trip to Peru during this time of year, hopefully this will help!"

We did need to check a bag on the way back to make room for souvenirs, but carry ons were sufficient for everything we needed to bring with us to Peru. One caveat: we stayed the first weekend with my aunt and uncle in Lima, so we were able to do laundry at their apartment the first weekend. You can use laundromats in the larger cities in Peru, have your hotel do some washing for you, or you can pack a couple more items of clothing than I suggest below. Here is what I brought for 8 full days:"
