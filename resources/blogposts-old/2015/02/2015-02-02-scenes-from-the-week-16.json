Sunday I started feeling really sick in the morning.... We hosted a Super Bowl party in our apartment's media room Sunday night, but I was unable to join because of my sickness. :( So, that was a big bummer. My husband made taco cupcakes (pictured below) for the party, and they were a big hit!"

This makes me very sad as I was motivated to consistently post throughout the year at the beginning of 2015.  Well, my job at my new office has required quite a bit more hours up front than I had expected, so I did not prepare in advance well enough. I'm going to try to blog more than I have the past couple weeks (which was not at all), but I'm also going to cut myself some slack if I don't reach my goals. Blogging with a busy career is tough, but I don't plan on stopping any time soon. :)"
