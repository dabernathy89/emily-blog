Saturday morning of that week we left the lake and went out for two days and one night on the Strip. I'd say we did a good job making the most of our short time there."

Even if you aren't going to stay the night there, I highly recommend just walking around to see all of the dining, shopping, and decor that the massive hotel has to offer. The location on the Strip cannot be beat - it's near several of the other major hotels and casinos that most people want to visit while in Vegas, and it is a short walk to a Las Vegas Monorail station that will get you to other parts of the Strip you may want to visit. I really wish we had had one more day there because we would have loved to spend a morning out by the hotel's gorgeous pools."

Just look at the gorgeous flowers, decor, and lighting! It's hard to believe that they switch out the exhibits after paying such attention to detail for this one. I just saw on the Bellagio website that this summer's theme is Under the Sea! I'd love to see that one!"
