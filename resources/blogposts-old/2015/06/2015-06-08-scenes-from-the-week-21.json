They are working through each and every episode of the show and talking about the pop culture references, the fashion, the dialogue, and everything about the episode. As a huge Gilmore Girls fan, I had a great time! Keiko Agena, the actress who plays Rory's best friend Lane Kim on the show, and Sarah Ramos, the actress who plays Haddie Braverman on Parenthood, made guest appearances and chatted with the guys about the episode for over an hour."
