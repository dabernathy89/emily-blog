I know this book has been over-hyped lately, but it is quite the page-turner! The one thing that somewhat disappointed me is that I was able to guess the end before I got there, but I enjoyed reading the book enough to not let that change my opinion too much. If you like suspense and mystery, I recommend picking this up! It's especially great for the rainy nights we have been having here in Texas lately."

We have hardwood floors now, so my orange and white cat's fur shows up EVERYWHERE. We went from vacuuming once a week to vacuuming almost every day whenever we moved into our new place. Now, I'll never enjoy vacuuming, but whipping out this light-weight vacuum is much quicker and easier to maneuver than our heavy duty vacuum. It does a great job picking up most of the fur, and the best part is, it was only $20!"

I've always picked up these magazines to flip through when hanging out at Barnes & Noble, and I usually purchase one or two before getting on a flight, but I've never subscribed to to any of them before. Last month, I found out that one-year subscriptions to these magazines are not that expensive, and they are definitely much cheaper than what I was spending by purchasing a couple individual magazines every few months at the airport. So, I just decided to subscribe to all of the ones that I enjoy flipping through - Conde Nast, Afar, National Geographic Traveler, and Travel + Leisure. I'm so glad I did! I get so excited when I see one of these waiting for me in the mail, and I've gotten a lot of inspiration for our "

Recently, Daniel's sister Sarah invited us to go to a live taping of the Gilmore Guys podcast. In the podcast, two guys who clearly love the show talk about each episode in detail - the fashion, the pop culture references (so many!), etc. To get ready for the taping, we watched one episode together, and I've watched several more episodes ever since. I just love it and hope to re-watch the whole series soon! If you've never seen the show, it's on Netflix, and it is binge-watch worthy.... :)"

Each day, I get one email (rather than 30+) with all of the sales ads, Goodreads notifications, Pinterest alerts, and anything else I have \"rolled up\". Within each of these emails, it notifies me if it found any new subscriptions from the day before and asks if I want to roll them up, keep them in my inbox, or unsubscribe! Yes, it unsubscribes from any email you ask it to! The only catch is after unsubscribing from ten or so emails, it asks you to share Unroll.me on Facebook. I was not a fan of this, but I went ahead and did it, and I've been able to unsubscribe from an unlimited amount of emails ever since. If you are tired of advertisements and other daily emails filling up your inbox, but you'd still like to be able to quickly scroll through this type of mail at your own leisure, this is the perfect solution for you!"
