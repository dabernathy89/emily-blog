Hated them? Have any recommendations of something I just have to add to the list? Those kinds of things. Also, making a list always motivates me, so it will encourage me to read more quickly through the list. I think I'll do these posts seasonally. Since my last post like this, I've also begun listening to audio books, so this list covers both audio books that I'll listen to and actual books I'll read. Here is what I plan to read over the next three months or so:"
