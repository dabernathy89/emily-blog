I purchased the calendar in the Blogilates app for a couple of dollars, and it allows me to check off each workout as I go and to access the YouTube video workouts straight from the app. This is useful since each day's work out is made up of an assortment of YouTube videos, so not having to search through YouTube for each one saves time. For some reason, I have not had any trouble getting up in the morning in time to do these 45 minute workouts - I almost look forward to it!"
