In these quick posts, I share the highlights from my previous week ranging from the simple, everyday things to the more memorable events. One of the primary reasons that I blog is to keep a journal that I can look back on in the future, and these posts help serve that purpose."

Daniel grew up going to church camp at Mo Ranch, a Presbyterian retreat in Hunt, Texas. He has been wanting to take me there for years, so we picked this weekend to go. Mo Ranch is a beautiful, peaceful place. In addition to Daniel showing me around to all his favorite spots, we swam in the river, ate delicious BBQ and cornbread muffins, and found a great viewpoint to watch the sunset. We also drove into Kerrville for lunch and my first Culver's custard experience (yum!), and, on our way home Sunday, we stopped in Fredericksburg to window shop in the cute stores and grab some lunch. We made one more stop closer to Austin at Pedernales Cellars for a wine tasting and gorgeous view of the Hill Country."
